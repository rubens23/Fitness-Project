    "body": "Whether your serve of choice is a floater, jump serve, jump float or just a basic overhand serve, the biomechanical principles are simple. To hit the ball through the defender or to place the ball where they are not, you must have both strength and power. A strength training program specifically designed to improve a volleyball serve must focus on strengthening the smaller muscles of the shoulder while simultaneously developing strength and power in the lower body. But before reviewing the program, let's look at the mechanics principles of a volleyball serve. Like normal weight-bearing activity, a serve involves the transmission of forces among the foot, ankle, lower leg, knee, thigh and hip. For a serve, the hand acts as a weight bearing surface, transmitting force to the wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm and shoulder girdle. Although most of the movements used in tennis and baseball are also used in volleyball, there is a slight difference in that volleyball players use a forward moving approach immediately followed by a vertical jump. This approach enables the server to gain horizontal momentum, which then must be converted to vertical momentum through subsequent flight."

    "body": "Do you want to be the volleyball player that stays healthy and dominates their competition? Do you want to take your volleyball game to the next level?  Let’s face it!  Being hurt hurts. An injured volleyball player is unable to play and this affects the entire volleyball team. A healthy volleyball player is an asset to their team. Staying healthy in volleyball is essential and working on hip stability as well as working to become more explosive in jumping for blocks and spiking is key.  Successful volleyball spiking and volleyball blocking is what every high school, club, and college team is looking for. It’s time to take your skill to the next level to be the volleyball player coaches are looking for. Split Squat Jump Drill: This drill is great for developing the hips to improve jump height with the extended lunge start position. This drill is also great for working on knee and hip stability with the catch portion of the drill, and the 3 second static hold at the bottom. Jump height can be increased by continually working for maximal height during the jump and stability can improve by keeping proper alignment in a static hold at the bottom."

    "body": "One of my previous jobs was helping a group of very talented beach volleyball players get stronger and faster. At the time I had just started fooling around with kettlebells on my own and even though my experience with them was limited at the time I could see a few ways kettlebells could be helpful to volleyball players. One of the biggest issues I had was that I had a bunch of really fast, explosive athletes in front of me but they would literally hurt themselves getting out of bed. (True story: one of the guys twisted his ankle getting out of bed for training and was off for three weeks). Typical volleyball training involves various plyometric work, such as rebound jumps and hitting and blocking drills. But when your guys are getting hurt getting out of bed in the morning you should probably think hard before you add in more work that may see them getting injured in training. So I wasn’t keen to add in jump training just yet. Besides, if we could get an improvement without needing shock training of any kind when we did finally start to use it they should become even more explosive. So we started fooling around with kettlebells and I taught them the same way I would teach anyone who just started using them. We began with swings and get ups. Not long into this something funny started happening. They all started telling me randomly about how fast they were moving and how high they were jumping. It had nothing to do with the sprint training either, as we spent more time working on landing skills and teaching body mechanics for all the various ways you need to move on court safely. So what happened?"

Some people think speed is something you are born with—you either have it or you don’t. This is not entirely true, and while some runners are genetically talented, you can train your body to go faster. Sprinting is a combination of acceleration, power, speed and technique. When you sprint, the fast twitch fibers in your muscles fire quickly and powerfully to drive explosive movement. While you can’t build more fast-twitch fibers, you can make them stronger and more efficient. A good speed-training program will develop and combine all these aspects of the sport to make you a better sprinter.Here are some of things you can do to improve on your speed."
