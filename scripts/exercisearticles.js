    body: "Process At the most basic level, weight loss occurs when your body uses more calories than you consume. Your body burns calories at rest, just to keep your various physiological systems functioning correctly. You burn calories through activity and using your muscles. You also burn calories by digesting and metabolizing the food you eat. Even thinking, which requires cellular communication between the neurons in your brain, burns calories. You take calories in, of course, through food. Therefore, the process of losing weight almost always begins with reducing the number of calories you eat and increasing the number of calories you burn, thus creating a caloric deficit. The most readily variable method of burning calories is physical activity, so exercise goes hand-in-hand with healthy nutrition in losing weight. When your body faces a caloric deficit, it must turn to stored sources of energy to meet its caloric needs. Most of the bodys excess calories are stored as fat, and the goal of most people in losing weight is to lose fat. As the body needs more energy than it takes in through food, it turns to these reserves (in addition to glycogen/sugar and sometimes protein reserves), and fat stores begin to deplete. As a rule of thumb, the body must have a caloric deficit of about 3,500 calories to lose one pound of stored fat. This translates to one pound fat loss per week if your daily caloric deficit through decreased intake and increased output is 500 calories." +
" <br> </br> Fat is stored in many individual cells, called adipocytes. The body usually maintains the same number of adipocytes, regardless of the amount of fat stored in each one. When weight gain occurs very quickly, however, the body may create more adipocytes to accommodate the drastically increased need for storage space. As weight loss occurs, the amount of fat in each adipocyte decreases, but the body usually doesnt destroy adipocytes once they have been created.<strong> Effects of Exercise </strong> <br> </br>" +
" Exercise (or more generally, physical activity) is usually the easiest way to increase the bodys demand for calories. A workout itself burns a significant number of calories. An aerobic workout such as walking or jogging usually burns more overall calories than a strength (resistance) workout, but both are important for various reasons. Combining them, as in many forms of circuit training, can be a very effective way to get the best of both worlds." +
" There is evidence that exercise causes an after-burn effect (known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption), which continues to keep the bodys caloric demands slightly elevated after the workout is over. This is due to the tissue repair that occurs when the muscles are recovering from exercise. Its much more pronounced following a resistance training workout than an aerobic workout. It" +
" s also more pronounced in deconditioned people. Once you become more fit, your body needs less additional energy to recover." +
" <br> <br> Exercise, especially resistance training, also increases the amount of muscle tissue in the body. Muscle tissue is very metabolically active; this means it takes a lot of energy (calories) for the body to keep the tissue alive, healthy and functioning correctly. Therefore, if you increase your muscle mass through exercise, your body burns a few extra calories, even at rest. Be careful, however, not to take exercise as a license to eat more. Remember, you are creating a caloric deficit. Furthermore, losing weight can actually reduce your metabolic rate because your body doesnt have to work as hard to move around and function correctly when it carries less weight." +
" <br> </br> The many other health benefits of exercise also help with weight loss. For instance, less stress, better immunity, better overall organ function, better sleep and more resistance to injury all help avoid the typical obstacles to an effective weight-loss program."

"The general question isn’t how will I lose weight or what do I need to do. Instead it’s, “How will this time be any different?” That’s because you’ve become conditioned to expect diets to fail. Much of the diet and fitness advice you need is overplayed, overhyped, and inaccurate. You are taking pieces of information and trying to create a Frankenstein approach to your body. That crap doesn’t work." +
"At some point you start making excuses because of constant roadblocks: Bad genetics, a hectic work schedule, and the typical Sunday football menu of burgers, wings, and beer (the same way the dating excuses line up, Seinfeld-style, like “she eats peas with a fork,” “she’s a low-talker,” etc.). The reality? The excuses are a bunch of bull. The techniques are filled with half-truths." +
"Here’s something most programs don’t tell you: Your body is designed to incinerate the hard-to-lose fat. You know those areas as man boobs, love handles, and thunder thighs. But the real problem is that you’ve been fed a steady diet of misinformation about what your body needs in order to look its best. And radical, dramatic steps are the last things your body needs. You need something more stable and sustainable." +
"Your body is the most sophisticated natural machine. It burns calories to help you perform all of your daily tasks, like standing up, thinking, and sleeping. This daily maintenance is called your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Everyone has a BMR, but the bigger you are, the faster your metabolism works. Think about that: The more weight you carry, the better your metabolism." +
"On the surface, that doesn’t make sense. After all, skinny people have better metabolisms, right? Well, not exactly. Think about it another way. Say you have two cars, an Audi and a Hummer. Which needs more fuel? The Hummer does, because it’s much larger and has more demands. Your body is no different. Everything you do, from powering your heart to helping you move from point A to point B requires energy. That’s why the larger you are, the harder your body needs to work and the more calories you burn. Your body wants to be an Audi; you just have to be willing to trade in for a new model." +
"So how do you become leaner? Surprisingly, it’s the small things that really make the biggest differences. And over time, those tiny changes add up to a lean, toned body." +
"Consider this a refreshing outlook on your transformation: Your metabolism isn’t holding you back, and your body isn’t hardwired to look a certain way. You can control your ability to lose weight. Simple, small adjustments to your diet, exercise, and other behaviors will make a surprisingly big difference and transform your body." +
"If you drop the stubborn act and change your strategy based on a few simple guidelines, you can literally switch your body into a fitter, healthier mode—it will burn more calories, build more muscle, and you’ll look amazing." +
"<br> </br> <strong> Is it Exercise or Diet? </strong> <br> </br>" +
"You can’t out-exercise a bad diet. That’s the most important rule of any successful plan. But a great diet without an exercise plan is incomplete. Your body needs to be active—both inside and outside the gym. Researchers have found that each 10 percent rise in sedentary time is associated with a 3.1-centimeter increase in the size of your waist. What’s more, British scientists found that of the subjects they studied, the waist measurements of people who got up most often were more than 2 inches smaller than those of people who got up the least." +
"Exercise and diet work, so there’s not need to try and create some mathematical formula that determines what percentage of which will determine results. Claims that it’s one or the other is more wishful thinking than reality. But change starts by realizing extreme behaviors in either are not the solution. After all, that’s where our battle of the bulge went wrong in the first place. Flash back to 1980s; that’s when dietary fat was identified as the root of all evil and cardio was elevated to the best form of exercise. Next thing you knew, the entire country was gorging on fat-free foods and going on slow jogs." +
"Fast-forward 30 years and those decades of eating fat-free, sugar-loaded foods have done anything but make us less fat. And all of that long-slow cardio primarily resulted in—you guessed it—long, slow weight loss. That’s not to say cardio is bad. It’s good. But it’s application to weight loss must be smarter." +
"Louisiana State University researchers found that the average number of calories burned during exercise dropped by 100 calories during the past 20 years, even though people were spending more time in the gym. So it should come as no surprise that the prevailing “best” approach to fat loss resulted in obesity rates skyrocketing to all-time highs. But more importantly, it left you more frustrated than ever." +
"You’ve probably heard this speech before. So before you hit the BS-button on your iPad, consider that for once you’re dealing with a more realistic approach to your body."

    "body":           "When you are not eating, your body is not absorbing food. If your body is not absorbing food, there is little insulin in the blood. However, your body is always using energy; and if youre not absorbing food, this energy must come from internal stores of complex carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Under these conditions, various organs in your body secrete hormones: <strong> pancreas - glucagon, pituitary gland - growth hormone, pituitary gland - ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), adrenal gland - epinephrine (adrenaline), thyroid gland - thyroid hormone </strong>These hormones act on cells of the liver, muscle and fat tissue, and have the opposite effects of insulin. <br> </br> When you are not eating, or you are exercising, your body must draw on its internal energy stores. Your bodys prime source of energy is glucose. In fact, some cells in your body, such as brain cells, can get energy only from glucose. The first line of defense in maintaining energy is to break down carbohydrates, or glycogen, into simple glucose molecules -- this process is called glycogenolysis. Next, your body breaks down fats into glycerol and fatty acids in the process of lipolysis. The fatty acids can then be broken down directly to get energy, or can be used to make glucose through a multi-step process called gluconeogenesis. In gluconeogenesis, amino acids can also be used to make glucose. In the fat cell, other types of lipases work to break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. These lipases are activated by various hormones, such as glucagon, epinephrine and growth hormone. The resulting glycerol and fatty acids are released into the blood, and travel to the liver through the bloodstream. Once in the liver, the glycerol and fatty acids can be either further broken down or used to make glucose. <br> </br> <strong> Losing Weight and Losing Fat </strong> Your weight is determined by the rate at which you store energy from the food that you eat, and the rate at which you use that energy. Remember that as your body breaks down fat, the number of fat cells remains the same; each fat cell simply gets smaller. <br> </br> <strong> Most experts agree that the way to maintain a healthy weight is: </strong> <br> </br> Eat a balanced diet - appropriate amounts of carbohydrates, fat and protein <br> </br> Do not eat excessively - for most people, a diet of 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day is sufficient to maintain a healthy weight <br> </br> Exercise regularly"

    "body":            " <strong> How To Lose Fat: The One Absolute Requirement</strong> <br> </br> Simply put… a caloric deficit. That is the scientifically proven “secret” to losing fat. It literally can’t happen any other way. So just what is a caloric deficit? It’s what happens when you burn more calories than you consume (or consume less calories than you burn… just another way of saying the same thing). Basically, every single person has a unique calorie maintenance level. This is the amount of calories that your body requires each day to burn for energy to perform all of the tasks it needs to perform. From intense exercise like cardio and weight training, to simple daily tasks like brushing your teeth and getting dressed, to the various physiological functions needed to keep you alive (like digesting and breathing). Calories are what our bodies use for energy to do all of these things, and we provide these calories via the foods we eat. As a result, 3 things can happen… <br> </br> <strong> The 3 Calorie Intake Scenarios </strong> <br> </br> If we consume the SAME number of calories that our bodies need to burn each day, we will be at our maintenance level. Our weight will be maintained because all of the calories we needed were provided. No more, no less. <br> </br> If we exceed this amount and therefore consume MORE calories than our bodies need, all of the left over calories that weren’t burned will then be stored on our body in some form for later use. And guess what form it’s most often stored in? Yup… body fat! This is known as a caloric surplus, and it is the one and only cause of fat gain. <br> </br> But what we’re interested in is the opposite of this… a caloric deficit. This is what happens when we consume LESS than our maintenance level amount. What happens then is that our bodies are forced to find some other source of energy to burn instead. And guess what that source most often is? Yup… your own stored body fat! And this is the one and only cause of fat loss. So if you maintain your current weight eating 2500 calories per day (just an example), you will gain weight (mostly in the form of body fat) if you consumed 3000 calories per day. However, you would lose weight (mostly in the form of body fat) if you consumed 2000 calories per day. This all remains true regardless of what the source of those calories are (carbs, fat, protein, healthy, unhealthy, clean, dirty, processed, unprocessed… whatever) or when/how they were consumed (after 7pm, in 3 large meals, in 6 small meals, every 2 hours, every 5 hours, whatever). <br> </br> <strong> Exercise Can Play A Role, Too </strong> <br> </br> See how it works? These are the proven fundamentals of how to lose fat, and that was a simple example of how to create the required caloric deficit via your diet alone (by eating less calories). I mention this because that same deficit could have also been created via exercise (by burning more calories). Meaning, you could have still eaten 2500 calories for the day in the previous example, but then burned an additional 500 through exercise thus creating the same caloric deficit. Both scenarios would effectively cause fat loss, as would a third scenario where you did a combination of both (diet AND exercise). But no matter which way you choose to do it, one absolute requirement ALWAYS stands. In order to lose fat, you MUST create a caloric deficit. Nothing else works."

    "body":           " <strong> HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING </strong> <br> </br> High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has become a popular way to burn more fat. It's a training method that has been effective for many people. <strong> WHAT IS HIIT? </strong> HIIT is a training idea in which low to moderate intensity intervals are alternated with high intensity intervals. HIIT can be applied to running or to exercises such as squatting. HIIT is considered to be much more effective than normal cardio because the intensity is higher and you are able to increase both your aerobic and anaerobic endurance while burning more fat than ever before.'In research, HIIT has been shown to burn adipose tissue more effectively than low-intensity exercise - up to 50% more efficiently.' It has also been shown to speed up your metabolism which helps you burn more calories throughout the day. (www.musclemedia.com) HIIT improves both energy systems for endurance: <br> </br> <strong> ANAEROBIC ENERGY SYSTEM </strong> Anaerobic literally means 'Without oxygen.' The anaerobic energy system is what provides energy in all out efforts of up to 1 minute. For the first 10-15 seconds, the phosphate pool is used up and after that, glycolysis and lactic acid are involved in the effort. During 10-15 second bursts, there is a very small amount of lactic acid produced. Rest periods of 30 seconds to a minute will provide complete recovery of the Adenosine Triphosphate-Creatine Phosphate (ATP-CP) system. During efforts of more than 10-15 seconds, a large amount of lactic acid is produced and such efforts are extremely taxing on both the athlete's muscles and their Central Nervous System (CNS). <br> </br> <strong> AEROBIC ENERGY SYSTEM </strong> Aerobic literally means 'with oxygen.' This energy system is utilized during prolonged exercise over a period of at least 3-4 minutes. As long as there is enough oxygen to provide energy, the fatigue that you experience will remain at a low level. This is the reason why many track and field athletes train at higher altitudes where there is less oxygen. By training at high altitudes, they can increase the number of red blood cells which will help them to perform for a longer period of time with little to no fatigue throughout."

    "body":           "<strong> What Makes Muscle Grow? </strong> <br> </br> </strong> If you want to develop more muscle, then you better get ready to do some hard work and prepare for slow gains. Learn about resistance training, diet and rest. I'm sure that most people who have performed some form of resistance training have wanted to increase their muscle mass at one time or another. But the body is just naturally lazy and will only develop enough muscle to deal with the loads placed upon it. So, if you want to develop more muscle, then you better get ready to do some hard work and prepare for slow gains, for the body will only respond to a combination of resistance training, diet and rest. </strong> <br> </br> <strong> TWO FORMS OF GROWTH </strong> <br> </br> Muscle growth comes about because of hypertrophy or hyperplasia. Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of the muscle due to an increase in the size of the muscle fibers, while hyperplasia is an increase in the number of muscle fibers. Hypertrophy comes in two forms, sarcomere hypertrophy, an increase in the size of the contractile portion of the muscle; and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, an increase in the non-contractile portion of the muscle. Sarcomere hypertrophy involves a smaller increase in the diameter of the muscle, but muscle density increases. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy shows an increase in muscle diameter and a decrease in density. All hypertrophy will involve both processes; the ratio is dependent on training intensity and frequency. Heavy training on a regular basis will make you feel solid whereas someone who trains for the pump with light weights will feel soft. If you are interested in improving performance, than strive for sarcomere hypertrophy. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is only beneficial if an increase in body weight is more important than an improvement in performance. <br> </br> <strong> HYPERPLASIA AND WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW </strong> <br> </br> Hyperplasia is the splitting of muscle fibers, resulting eventually in a greater number of fibers the same size as the originals. It has been said that the number of muscle cells one is born with is all they will ever have, and the splitting is not new fibers but damage to existing fibers. Russian sports scientists claimed to find hyperplasia in swimmers' shoulders. Swimming is training at a high speed with low resistance. Other researchers have produced hyperplasia in chickens and grouse by hanging them by their wings for a few days. I do not know if hyperplasia is possible, but if you want to do a little experiment, I would train at high speed as opposed to hanging yourself in a stretched out position for the weekend. <br> </br> <strong> BREAKING DOWN </strong> <br> </br> The process of muscle growth is not known for sure, but most theories are based on the idea that lifting breaks down the muscle, and growth results from over-compensating to protect the body from future stress. The human body breaks down and rebuilds all of the muscles every 15 to 30 days. Lifting speeds up the process due to an increased need for fuel. Rebuilding peaks 24 to 36 hours after training and continues at increased rates for as much as 72 hours. The muscle hypoxia theory is that weight training decreases muscle oxygen content, and that triggers protein synthesis. It came from the fact that lifting loads over 60% of maximum temporarily cuts off blood flow. Restricting blood flow with a tourniquet does not result in muscle growth, and pearl divers are not overly muscular, so the muscle hypoxia theory can be thrown out. Another theory is that training increases blood flow and the increased nutrient supply is responsible for growth. It sounds good, but running increases blood flow and not too many distance runners have big legs. The ATP debt theory is that muscles use ATP contract, so ATP will break down and the waste products will trigger increased blood flow and growth. It has been discounted because ATP levels are the same following exercising to failure as at rest, and runners still do not have big legs. <br> </br> <strong> ENERGETIC THEORY </strong> <br> </br> The energetic theory that is currently the most accepted is that muscle has a certain amount of energy at any given time, for growth, repair, and movement. Soviet sport scientists have referred to this as an individual's current adaptive reserve. Over time, with a lot of hard work, the body becomes more efficient at breaking down and rebuilding muscle, which shows an increase in the current adaptive reserve. Increased energy supply allows more work to be accomplished, followed by increased growth."

    "publishedOn":        "2013-09-17",
    "body":          "<strong> The Physiology Of Muscle Growth </strong> <br> </br> After you workout, your body repairs or replaces damaged muscle fibers through a cellular process where it fuses muscle fibers together to form new muscle protein strands or myofibrils. These repaired myofibrils increase in thickness and number to create muscle hypertrophy (growth).1 Muscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown. This adaption, however, does not happen while you actually lift the weights. Instead, it occurs while you rest. So how do you actually add muscle to your muscle cells? This is where Satellite cells come in and act like stem cells for your muscles. When activated, they help to add more nuclie to the muscle cells and therefore contribute directly to the growth of myofibrils (muscle cells). Activating these satellite cells may be the difference between what allows certain “genetic freaks” to grow massive muscles and what makes other people “hard-gainers.2” In one of the most interesting studies in the past 5 years, researchers showed that those who were “extreme responders” to muscle growth, with an incredible 58% myofiber hypertrophy from an exercise, had 23% activation of their satellite cells. Modest responders, who had a 28% growth, had 19% activation of their satellite cells. What is interesting to note, though, is that some people known as “non-responders” in the study had 0% growth and had a concurrent 0% activation of their satellite cells. Therefore, it seems the more you can activate these satellite cells, the more you’ll be able to grow. So then the question becomes, how do you activate these satellite cells to increase muscle growth? <br> </br> <strong> 3 Mechanisms That Make Muscles Grow </strong> <br> </br> Underlying all progression of natural muscle growth is the ability to continually put more stress on the muscles. This stress is a major component involved in the growth of a muscle and disrupts homeostasis within your body. The stress and subsequent disruption in homeostasis causes three main mechanisms that spur on muscle growth. <br> </br> <strong> Muscle Growth Mechanism #1: Muscle Tension </strong> <br> </br> In order to produce muscle growth, you have to apply a load of stress greater than what your body or muscles had previously adapted too. How do you do this? The main way is to lift progressively heavier weights. This additional tension on the muscle helps to cause changes in the chemistry of the muscle, allowing for growth factors that include mTOR activation and satellite cell activation. Muscular tension also most dramatically effects the connection of the motor units with the muscle cells. Two other factors help to explain why some people can be stronger, but not as big as other people. <br> </br> <strong> Muscle Growth Mechanism #2: Muscle Damage  </strong> <br> </br> If you’ve ever felt sore after a workout, you have experienced the localized muscle damage from working out. This local muscle damage causes a release of inflammatory molecules and immune system cells that activate satellite cells to jump into action. This doesn’t mean that you have to feel sore in order for this to happen, but instead that the damage from the workout has to be present in your muscle cells. Typically soreness is attenuated over time by other mechanisms. <br> </br> <strong> Muscle Growth Mechanism #3: Metabolic Stress </strong> <br> </br> If you’ve ever felt the burn of an exercise or had the “pump” in the gym, then you’ve felt the effects of metabolic stress. Scientists used to question bodybuilders when they said the “pump” caused their muscles to become larger. After more investigation, it seems as though they were onto something. Metabolic stress causes cell swelling around the muscle, which helps to contribute to muscle growth without necessarily increasing the size of the muscle cells. This is from the addition of muscle glycogen, which helps to swell the muscle along with connective tissue growth. This type of growth is known as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and is one of the ways that people can get the appearance of larger muscles without increases in strength. So now that you know the three main mechanisms of muscle growth, the next question is: how do hormones affect muscle growth?"

    "body":          "<strong> Maximize Muscle Building </strong> <br> </br> <strong> Eat Meat </strong> <br> </br> Shoot for about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, which is roughly the maximum amount your body can use in a day, according to a landmark study in the Journal of Applied Physiology. (For example, a 160-pound man should consume 160 grams of protein a day—the amount he'd get from an 8-ounce chicken breast, 1 cup of cottage cheese, a roast-beef sandwich, two eggs, a glass of milk, and 2 ounces of peanuts.) Split the rest of your daily calories equally between carbohydrates and fats. <strong> Eat More 1 </strong> <br> In addition to adequate protein, you need more calories. Use the following formula to calculate the number you need to take in daily to gain 1 pound a week. (Give yourself 2 weeks for results to show up on the bathroom scale. If you haven't gained by then, increase your calories by 500 a day.) A. Your weight in pounds. <br> B. Multiply A by 12 to get your basic calorie needs. <br> C. Multiply B by 1.6 to estimate your resting metabolic rate (calorie burn without factoring in exercise). <br> D. Strength training: Multiply the number of minutes you lift weights per week by 5. <br> E. Aerobic training: Multiply the number of minutes per week that you run, cycle, and play sports by 8. <br>F. Add D and E, and divide by 7. <br> G. Add C and F to get your daily calorie needs. <br> H. Add 500 to G. This is your estimated daily calorie needs to gain 1 pound a week. <br> <strong> Work Your Biggest Muscles </strong> <br> If you're a beginner, just about any workout will be intense enough to increase protein synthesis. But if you've been lifting for a while, you'll build the most muscle quickest if you focus on the large muscle groups, like the chest, back, and legs. Add squats, deadlifts, pullups, bent-over rows, bench presses, dips, and military presses to your workout. Do two or three sets of eight to 12 repetitions, with about 60 seconds' rest between sets. <strong> Have a Stiff Drink </strong> <br> A 2001 study at the University of Texas found that lifters who drank a shake containing amino acids and carbohydrates before working out increased their protein synthesis more than lifters who drank the same shake after exercising. The shake contained 6 grams of essential amino acids—the muscle-building blocks of protein—and 35 grams of carbohydrates. For your shake, you'll need about 20 grams of protein—usually about one scoop of a whey-protein powder. Can't stomach protein drinks? You can get the same nutrients from a sandwich made with 4 ounces of deli turkey and a slice of American cheese on whole wheat bread. But a drink is better. 'Liquid meals are absorbed faster,' says Kalman. So tough it out. Drink one 30 to 60 minutes before your workout. <strong> Lift Every Other Day </strong> <br> Do a full-body workout followed by a day of rest. Studies show that a challenging weight workout increases protein synthesis for up to 48 hours immediately after your exercise session. 'Your muscles grow when you're resting, not when you're working out,' says Michael Mejia, C.S.C.S., Men's Health exercise advisor and a former skinny guy who packed on 40 pounds of muscle using this very program. <strong> Down Carbs After Your Workout </strong> <br> Research shows that you'll rebuild muscle faster on your rest days if you feed your body carbohydrates. Post-workout meals with carbs increase your insulin levels, which, in turn, slows the rate of protein breakdown, says Kalman. Have a banana, a sports drink, a peanut-butter sandwich. <strong> Eat Every 3 Hours </strong> <br> 'If you don't eat often enough, you can limit the rate at which your body builds new proteins,' says Houston. Take the number of calories you need in a day and divide by six. That's roughly the number you should eat at each meal. Make sure you consume some protein—around 20 grams—every 3 hours. <strong> Make One Snack Ice Cream </strong> <br> Have a bowl of ice cream (any kind) 2 hours after your workout. According to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, this snack triggers a surge of insulin better than most foods do. And that'll put a damper on post-workout protein breakdown. <strong> Have Some Milk Before Bed </strong> <br> Eat a combination of carbohydrates and protein 30 minutes before you go to bed. The calories are more likely to stick with you during sleep and reduce protein breakdown in your muscles, says Kalman. Try a cup of raisin bran with a cup of skim milk or a cup of cottage cheese and a small bowl of fruit. Eat again as soon as you wake up. 'The more diligent you are, the better results you'll get,' says Kalman."

  "body": "<strong> Core Strength: The Ultimate Guide to Core Strength </strong> <br> <strong> CORE PRINCIPLES </strong> <br> The core is a collection of muscles which stabilize and move the spine. Close to the spine and deep inside the abdomen is the inner core, which is comprised of the diaphragm, pelvic floor, multifidi, deep cervical flexors, and transverse abdominus. These strange-sounding muscles engage first during movement or breathing to protect the spine. The outer core muscles are also responsible for stabilizing and protecting the spine, but they also have more defined movement functions. The anterior muscles (abdominals) are the most well-known members of the outer-core assembly. The lats, spinal erectors, glute complex, quadratus lumborum, and hip flexors are also outer-core muscles. If you want to get academic, you could make an argument that the core extends far beyond these muscles localized to the spine and hip complex. But for our current scope, the muscles I just mentioned nicely define the core. <br> <strong> SIMPLIFIED CORE STRENGTH </strong> <br> Purposeful core action requires understanding its function. The core stabilizes and protects the spine by creating stiffness that limits excessive movement in any direction—most notably extension, flexion, lateral flexion, and rotation. In lifting terms, the core's responsibility is to limit movement. Think about the core through the scope of strength exercises like the squat, deadlift, bench press, and overhead press. These movements require the spine to hold a rigid position so the hip and shoulder joints can move with force. The core muscles create the rigid spine position. To make the core stronger, you only need to let it do its job and protect the spine when you put heavy loads in your hands or on your shoulders. From this perspective, every exercise is a core exercise. Complete an exercise with good form and you trained the core to do its job. Consistently increase the load of an exercise using good form and you make the core stronger."

  "body":        "<strong> What is Core </strong> <br> If you’re newer to training or getting back into shape, I’m sure you’ve heard about core training. Perhaps you’ve heard about it in magazines or maybe your doctor recommended it. So, that’s all great and you want to start working on your core strength - but you have no idea where to start and you’re not exactly sure what the “core” really means. The core is a term used to describe just about everything on your body that isn’t your legs and arms. This means you can think of your glutes, hips, abdominal muscles, inner abdominal muscles, pelvic floor, and scapula as your core. Your core is where your power is generated in order to carry out any movement. While abdominal and inner abdominal muscles do play a large roll in core stability, they don’t make up the core all by themselves. + <img src = '../Images/Core.jpg'> + A mistake many people make is to think of their core as only being their abs, and because of this they go about training their core in many ineffective ways. Traditional ab exercises like crunches and sit ups are often used in hopes of achieving a stronger core and more defined abdominals, but this is a terrible method. Not only does performing endless crunches and sit ups not strengthen your core or give you more defined abs, it can be hazardous to your spine. Furthermore, crunches don’t work your abs in the way these muscles were designed to perform. The main function of the abdominals is to support the spine and prevent it from spinning all the way around, breaking over backward, or flexing to the side. The crunching movement is a secondary function and one that’s not meant to be done at high volume due to the stress it puts on the discs of your spine. In order to train the core effectively, we need to train all the muscles involved, starting slowly and building a foundation. These muscles need to work together as a team. Think of developing your core stability as pouring the concrete base for your home. This base provides structure and safety. It also cannot be rushed or overlooked. You wouldn’t build a home on soggy ground because your house would sink or fall apart. The same can be said for your body when it comes to developing your core."

  "body":           "<strong> What is so important about Core strength </strong> <br> Core Strength has been something of a buzz term recently, but I admit -- until yesterday, I wasn’t sure what the big deal was all about. Isn’t core training just a fancy way of saying toning your abs? Our moms used to simply call this doing sit-ups. But there’s way more to core training than the abdominals (and getting a flat tummy), says Dena Stern, personal trainer and managing editor of Exercise.com. I spoke with Stern yesterday about why core strength is so important -- and easy ways you can add more of it to your workout routine. <br> What exactly is core strength or core training? Core training does two really important things -- it helps you look thinner, and it supports your spine and helps with things like balance. I noticed when I started doing Pilates and a lot of core engagement that it got easier to snowboard, or do complicated yoga poses, also. Those core muscles ares connected to your legs, to the way you stand, squat, sit. It’s not just about the abdominal muscles, but also training your back, your glutes, and the entire area that connects to your spinal cord and helps your body support your spine, so that the burden of supporting your body weight isn’t just placed on your bones. The core is actually made up of three sheaths of muscles: The upper abs, the side muscles, which are called the obliques, and then this very deep layer of muscle. Those deep muscles are the ones that do all the good stuff, like support your spine and act as a natural corset—so when you work them not only do you get a flatter stomach but a tighter stomach. <br> What’s the difference between core training and working your abs? The difference between core and abdominal training is that you’re not just targeting the front side of the body but the back side as well. A core workout will also include the erector spinae, which are he muscles that make up your back, and also your glutes. A movement that works your core is going to work more than one muscle group, and you’re going to see results a lot faster. So are crunches useless? Crunches are really important, because before you can engage your deeper core, you need that strength in your abdominal muscles. You have to build that strength, and doing crunches is a great way for somebody to build up, to work towards getting a stronger core. I think crunches are boring, and people hate them, so the idea of doing a lot of crunches doesn’t get people excited about exercise. Given a minute, I can think of four exercises other than crunches with no equipment that would give you results faster. But there are ways to make a crunch more challenging. Introducing instability is one of my favorites. Doing a crunch on a ball, or a foam roller, your body is going to be balancing so you won’t just be working the abs, you’ll be stabilizing the core. There’s no such thing as a bad exercise -- my personal opinion is anything you like enough to do is good. I like to do crunches when I’m sitting home watching TV, instead of reaching for the chips. What’s important about a crunch is doing it correctly -- drawing your belly button toward your spine, moving your ribs toward your hips, moving your shoulders up to you chest -- but its a small movement. That movement should be incredibly challenging, and it doesn’t get easier. If you do it with mind-fullness, it can be a challenging exercise. <br> Why does core strength matter so much, anyway? This is one of my favorite topics! The reason I became an advocate for core-training was my mother. We’re both kind of top-heavy women, and after 50 years supporting the weight of her own body, she starting having bone spurs poking out of her spine. She had to get a very serious surgery. And her doctor told her, You have a daughter, right? Tell her she should start working her core now, because it’s so much easier to build core strength now and just keep it up as you get older. It’s not just about looking good in a bikini -- core training is something I can do to take care of my body as I age, you know? I sit at a desk at a computer all day, 12 hours a day, and this is a way that I can keep myself from having horrible back pain as I age. <br> What are the best workouts for building core strength? If people want to really improve their core strength, introducing instability into workouts they’re already doing and Pilates are both really great ways. I love Pilates. If you’re looking for one exercise that does get results in your core, definitely Pilates. I do exercise that are a mix of Pilates and yoga -- doing a plank or a superman or Hundreds, you’re forcing the muscles to work together, instead of just isolating a specific muscle like you do in strength training. I would also say any exercise you do on a Bosu -- it’s like half of an exercise ball on a flat black surface, and they’re fantastic. When I do squats, I do them on a Bosu -- just flip it over and do it on the back side. Or I’ll do lunges with one foot on the Bosu. It engages your core, because you have to stabilize yourself on that surface. Try introducing instability into every exercise you do."

  "body":           "<strong> 7 Ways to boost your endurance and stamina </strong> <br> </br> 1. Combine strength days with cardio days. <br> It’s a simple equation: the more muscle you can get working, the more it will challenge your heart and your cardiovascular system. Instead of building cardio-only workouts (the pitfall that’ll prevent you from building endurance) make sure to weave strength days into your training. Most people reserve one day for strength and another day for cardio. Try combining the two instead, says Torres. Use a bench press, immediately followed by pull-ups, then run a mile as fast as you can… and repeat. Another good example: Jump rope for a minute, followed by squats, an overhead press, and finally sit ups. Repeat. <br> 2. Reduce your amount of rest. <br> Men typically give themselves between 30 and 90 seconds of recovery time in between sets, but if your goal is greater endurance, be prepared to sacrifice break time. By the end of your sets, your muscles should be burning—you should be breathing heavily and sweating, says Torres. Only take a break if you physically can not continue. Torres suggests selecting a series of movements like 10 pull-ups, 10 squats, 10 push-ups, 10 sit-ups. Do three rounds of the series back to back, taking as minimal a break as possible. <br> 3. Do fast-paced, high-intensity lifting. <br> When you use weights at an extremely rapid pace, it will not only improve your strength, but also carry over to improve your endurance activity,” says Torres. “It’s one of the best ways to ignite your metabolism. When people do an excessive amount of endurance-only training, they actually slow down their metabolism because it starts to eat away at your muscle tissue. <br> 4. Choose compound movements over isolation. <br> Compound moves that require using more than one joint—like squats, step-ups, push-ups and pull-ups—will improve your endurance more so than exercises in isolation. Isolated exercises like bicep curls and leg lifts aren’t going to stimulate you enough to increase your stamina, he says. <br> 5. Remember: Routine is the enemy. <br> Switching up your workout is essential to building endurance and stamina. According to Torres, the human body gets used to a workout after two weeks. So if you’re always running, start doing Muay Thai instead. Or if you’re an avid cyclist, change it up by running stairs. You need to move the muscles in a different way so that you don’t develop overuse. Plus, it becomes more motivating,” he says. It’s important to keep the mind guessing. <br> 6. Go for hybrid exercises. <br> A squat with an added overhead press (a thruster), jumping pull-ups, and lunges with bicep curls are all great hybrids: exercises that take two separate movements and combine them. The more muscles you can get working in a movement, the more it will stimulate your heart muscles, which in turn improves your stamina. <br> 7. Add explosive movements to your workout. <br> Explosive movements that take a lot of energy challenge your strength, endurance and stamina simultaneously. Once you become more explosive, you’ll notice that you’ll actually start moving faster. Torres says: try adding things like burpees, box jumps, jumping knee tucks and power push-ups to your workout routine."

  "body":           "<strong> Do you have a hard time catching your breath after taking the stairs? </strong> <br> You may need to build your cardiovascular endurance. Stamina is our ability to sustain prolonged activity. We live in a sedentary society. Elevators help you avoid the stairs. Valets prevent you from having to walk from your car. Aerobic or endurance activities improve the heart’s ability to circulate oxygenated blood and the body’s ability to use oxygen, states Harvard Medical School. Fortunately you can increase your cardio stamina by following a simple workout routine. <br> Assess your current level of stamina. Try running or walking for one mile and record your time. Repeat on a weekly basis. Aim to increase your speed and lower your time every week. Perform slow long distance cardio. Jog or walk for 60 minutes twice per week at a low intensity. Gauge your intensity by using the talk test. You should be able to hold a conversation without being too winded. According to Sports Fitness Advisor, this form of aerobic endurance training improved cardiovascular and thermoregulatory function, improved mitochondrial energy production, increased oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle and increased utilization of fat for fuel. <br> Try circuit training. Circuit training involves planning eight to 10 different activities and then performing each activity for one to three minutes before moving on to the next. Set your dumbbells at one end of the room, your kettlebells or resistance bands at another and your aerobic step platform at another. Your elliptical or rowing machine can also act as stations, if you have them. Perform cardio activities like running on the spot and jumping jacks in between activities that require equipment. Because there is little to no rest in between exercises, your heart rate stays elevated for the entire workout improving cardiovascular health. Take the assessment in Step 1 to chart your progress after executing this program for 30 days. You can build cardiovascular stamina fairly quickly; but if you have not exercised for awhile, start by taking short, brisk walks. A 15 minute fast walk every night for a week will get you used to the effort it requires to perform aerobic exercise. It's better to ease into a workout program than quit because it's too much for you at the beginning."

  "publishedOn":        "2012-12-16",
  "body":          "<strong> What is Cardiovascular Endurance? </strong> <br> Cardiovascular endurance is the ability of the heart, lungs and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to your body tissues. The more efficiently your body delivers oxygen to its tissues, the lower your breathing rate is. While this may help you get a little more bottom time from each tank of air, the real benefits are being more relaxed during each dive, experiencing less fatigue and being better able to respond to challenging currents, long swims and any emergencies that may arise. Essentially, a stronger, more efficient oxygen delivery system allows you to dive with greater ease in any situation. The good news is that you can improve your cardiovascular endurance through a sensible program of regular aerobic exercise performed within a target range of 60 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate (MHR). Most people see significant improvement in about three months as the heart muscle grows stronger and pumps more blood with each beat. Blood vessels become more elastic, reducing blood pressure, and capillaries — the tiny vessels that actually deliver oxygen to your tissues — create more branches. Oxygen is taken up by the tissues more effectively as the density of oxygen receptors (called mitochondria) increases. The net result is a positive effect on overall health and wellness. <br> Resting Heart Rage: An Indicator of Cardiovascular Endurance <br> Your resting heart rate (RHR) is both a reliable indicator of cardiovascular endurance and the baseline measurement for monitoring your aerobic workouts. An untrained individual has an RHR of approximately 70 beats per minute (bpm), while an elite athlete like Lance Armstrong may have an RHR of approximately 35 bpm. A healthy goal is around 65 bpm. Try measuring your RHR on three separate occasions; multiple attempts minimize any impact of nervousness or technique. If you discover an RHR above 80 bpm, see a physician before beginning a cardiovascular training program. Your RHR can be determined by taking your pulse (radial or carotid) first thing in the morning before you get out of bed, ideally after a good night's sleep. Count beats for 30 seconds and multiply by two to determine beats per minute. Repeat the process over several days, and take the average as your true RHR. Check for accuracy by comparing your count to a heart rate monitor or by having a partner count, too; have him or her count your radial while you count your carotid pulse, and see if you get the same result. <br> The FITT Principles <br> Once you know your RHR, it's time to build an aerobic exercise regimen. An effective workout is a balance between frequency, intensity, type and time (FITT). FITT principles will help you manage your fitness plan, but always listen to your body to achieve an appropriate balance. An aerobic training program is supposed to decrease stress levels, not increase them. <br> Frequency <br> The American College of Sports Medicine currently recommends that healthy adults participate in moderate aerobic exercise 30 minutes a day, five days a week, or vigorous cardio exercise 20 minutes a day, three days per week. Follow these guidelines, and you should start feeling the results within the first few days. Unfortunately, detraining also occurs quickly, so it is important to make sure there are no more than two days of rest between cardio workouts. Although these guidelines are ideal, remember that any exercise is better than no exercise. If you can squeeze in even 5-10 minutes, it will help to maintain your current fitness level. <br> Intensity <br> Cardiovascular endurance improves when you exercise in an aerobic training zone that elevates your heart rate to somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of your maximum heart rate. To find your MHR, subtract your age from 220. Your true MHR should fall within 12 beats above or below this number. Then use these formulas to find the upper and lower range: <br> Aerobic Training Zone <br> ((MHR - RHR) × .60) + RHR = Lower Limit of Range <br> ((MHR - RHR) × .85)+ RHR = Upper Limit of Range <br> Shorter workouts will be closer to the upper limit, while longer workouts will be closer to the lower limit. Interval training, which alternates bursts of vigorous and moderate intensity, has a greater impact in a shorter time. Use the low-intensity range for a warm-up, then begin with a 1:1 work/rest ratio. For example: Follow 30 seconds of activity with 30 seconds of recovery. There are countless variations of intensity levels depending on the duration of your workout, work/rest ratios and where you want to be within the lower or upper limits of each training zone. <br> Type <br> Common aerobic activities include walking, jogging, swimming, cycling and stair climbing, but it doesn't matter what type of exercise you choose as long as you stay in your training zone. Choose aerobic activities that you enjoy and can realistically fit into your daily routine. Consider mixing activities to alleviate boredom, work different muscle groups and avoid overuse injuries. Strength training can also meet cardiovascular needs if you minimize or eliminate the waiting time between exercises and keep your heart rate elevated. The push-pull structure of the strength training workouts in the last three Dive Fitness columns allow you to improve cardiovascular endurance while improving muscle strength. <br> Time <br> Time is the duration of a given workout. Your goal should be a minimum of 30 minutes in your target range (20 minutes for interval training) per workout. If you're having trouble reaching that at first, take baby steps. Start with accumulating 30 minutes in your target range over the course of a day; try 10 minutes before breakfast, 10 minutes before lunch and 10 minutes before dinner. Keep your heart rate up for a little while today and a little longer tomorrow. Once you've established an aerobic workout routine, stick with it. If time is tight, shorten your workout but increase the intensity. If you are tired before you start, plan for a less intense workout, but extend the time. Above all, be realistic with your goals, and remember this is a program for life."
