    body: "Process At the most basic level, weight loss occurs when your body uses more calories than you consume. Your body burns calories at rest, just to keep your various physiological systems functioning correctly. You burn calories through activity and using your muscles. You also burn calories by digesting and metabolizing the food you eat. Even thinking, which requires cellular communication between the neurons in your brain, burns calories. You take calories in, of course, through food. Therefore, the process of losing weight almost always begins with reducing the number of calories you eat and increasing the number of calories you burn, thus creating a caloric deficit. The most readily variable method of burning calories is physical activity, so exercise goes hand-in-hand with healthy nutrition in losing weight. When your body faces a caloric deficit, it must turn to stored sources of energy to meet its caloric needs. Most of the bodys excess calories are stored as fat, and the goal of most people in losing weight is to lose fat. As the body needs more energy than it takes in through food, it turns to these reserves (in addition to glycogen/sugar and sometimes protein reserves), and fat stores begin to deplete. As a rule of thumb, the body must have a caloric deficit of about 3,500 calories to lose one pound of stored fat. This translates to one pound fat loss per week if your daily caloric deficit through decreased intake and increased output is 500 calories." +
" <br> </br> Fat is stored in many individual cells, called adipocytes. The body usually maintains the same number of adipocytes, regardless of the amount of fat stored in each one. When weight gain occurs very quickly, however, the body may create more adipocytes to accommodate the drastically increased need for storage space. As weight loss occurs, the amount of fat in each adipocyte decreases, but the body usually doesnt destroy adipocytes once they have been created.<strong> Effects of Exercise </strong> <br> </br>" +
" Exercise (or more generally, physical activity) is usually the easiest way to increase the bodys demand for calories. A workout itself burns a significant number of calories. An aerobic workout such as walking or jogging usually burns more overall calories than a strength (resistance) workout, but both are important for various reasons. Combining them, as in many forms of circuit training, can be a very effective way to get the best of both worlds." +
" There is evidence that exercise causes an after-burn effect (known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption), which continues to keep the bodys caloric demands slightly elevated after the workout is over. This is due to the tissue repair that occurs when the muscles are recovering from exercise. Its much more pronounced following a resistance training workout than an aerobic workout. It" +
" s also more pronounced in deconditioned people. Once you become more fit, your body needs less additional energy to recover." +
" <br> <br> Exercise, especially resistance training, also increases the amount of muscle tissue in the body. Muscle tissue is very metabolically active; this means it takes a lot of energy (calories) for the body to keep the tissue alive, healthy and functioning correctly. Therefore, if you increase your muscle mass through exercise, your body burns a few extra calories, even at rest. Be careful, however, not to take exercise as a license to eat more. Remember, you are creating a caloric deficit. Furthermore, losing weight can actually reduce your metabolic rate because your body doesnt have to work as hard to move around and function correctly when it carries less weight." +
" <br> </br> The many other health benefits of exercise also help with weight loss. For instance, less stress, better immunity, better overall organ function, better sleep and more resistance to injury all help avoid the typical obstacles to an effective weight-loss program."

"The general question isn’t how will I lose weight or what do I need to do. Instead it’s, “How will this time be any different?” That’s because you’ve become conditioned to expect diets to fail. Much of the diet and fitness advice you need is overplayed, overhyped, and inaccurate. You are taking pieces of information and trying to create a Frankenstein approach to your body. That crap doesn’t work." +
"At some point you start making excuses because of constant roadblocks: Bad genetics, a hectic work schedule, and the typical Sunday football menu of burgers, wings, and beer (the same way the dating excuses line up, Seinfeld-style, like “she eats peas with a fork,” “she’s a low-talker,” etc.). The reality? The excuses are a bunch of bull. The techniques are filled with half-truths." +
"Here’s something most programs don’t tell you: Your body is designed to incinerate the hard-to-lose fat. You know those areas as man boobs, love handles, and thunder thighs. But the real problem is that you’ve been fed a steady diet of misinformation about what your body needs in order to look its best. And radical, dramatic steps are the last things your body needs. You need something more stable and sustainable." +
"Your body is the most sophisticated natural machine. It burns calories to help you perform all of your daily tasks, like standing up, thinking, and sleeping. This daily maintenance is called your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Everyone has a BMR, but the bigger you are, the faster your metabolism works. Think about that: The more weight you carry, the better your metabolism." +
"On the surface, that doesn’t make sense. After all, skinny people have better metabolisms, right? Well, not exactly. Think about it another way. Say you have two cars, an Audi and a Hummer. Which needs more fuel? The Hummer does, because it’s much larger and has more demands. Your body is no different. Everything you do, from powering your heart to helping you move from point A to point B requires energy. That’s why the larger you are, the harder your body needs to work and the more calories you burn. Your body wants to be an Audi; you just have to be willing to trade in for a new model." +
"So how do you become leaner? Surprisingly, it’s the small things that really make the biggest differences. And over time, those tiny changes add up to a lean, toned body." +
"Consider this a refreshing outlook on your transformation: Your metabolism isn’t holding you back, and your body isn’t hardwired to look a certain way. You can control your ability to lose weight. Simple, small adjustments to your diet, exercise, and other behaviors will make a surprisingly big difference and transform your body." +
"If you drop the stubborn act and change your strategy based on a few simple guidelines, you can literally switch your body into a fitter, healthier mode—it will burn more calories, build more muscle, and you’ll look amazing." +
"<br> </br> <strong> Is it Exercise or Diet? </strong> <br> </br>" +
"You can’t out-exercise a bad diet. That’s the most important rule of any successful plan. But a great diet without an exercise plan is incomplete. Your body needs to be active—both inside and outside the gym. Researchers have found that each 10 percent rise in sedentary time is associated with a 3.1-centimeter increase in the size of your waist. What’s more, British scientists found that of the subjects they studied, the waist measurements of people who got up most often were more than 2 inches smaller than those of people who got up the least." +
"Exercise and diet work, so there’s not need to try and create some mathematical formula that determines what percentage of which will determine results. Claims that it’s one or the other is more wishful thinking than reality. But change starts by realizing extreme behaviors in either are not the solution. After all, that’s where our battle of the bulge went wrong in the first place. Flash back to 1980s; that’s when dietary fat was identified as the root of all evil and cardio was elevated to the best form of exercise. Next thing you knew, the entire country was gorging on fat-free foods and going on slow jogs." +
"Fast-forward 30 years and those decades of eating fat-free, sugar-loaded foods have done anything but make us less fat. And all of that long-slow cardio primarily resulted in—you guessed it—long, slow weight loss. That’s not to say cardio is bad. It’s good. But it’s application to weight loss must be smarter." +
"Louisiana State University researchers found that the average number of calories burned during exercise dropped by 100 calories during the past 20 years, even though people were spending more time in the gym. So it should come as no surprise that the prevailing “best” approach to fat loss resulted in obesity rates skyrocketing to all-time highs. But more importantly, it left you more frustrated than ever." +
"You’ve probably heard this speech before. So before you hit the BS-button on your iPad, consider that for once you’re dealing with a more realistic approach to your body."

    "body":           "When you are not eating, your body is not absorbing food. If your body is not absorbing food, there is little insulin in the blood. However, your body is always using energy; and if youre not absorbing food, this energy must come from internal stores of complex carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Under these conditions, various organs in your body secrete hormones: <strong> pancreas - glucagon, pituitary gland - growth hormone, pituitary gland - ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), adrenal gland - epinephrine (adrenaline), thyroid gland - thyroid hormone </strong>These hormones act on cells of the liver, muscle and fat tissue, and have the opposite effects of insulin. <br> </br> When you are not eating, or you are exercising, your body must draw on its internal energy stores. Your bodys prime source of energy is glucose. In fact, some cells in your body, such as brain cells, can get energy only from glucose. The first line of defense in maintaining energy is to break down carbohydrates, or glycogen, into simple glucose molecules -- this process is called glycogenolysis. Next, your body breaks down fats into glycerol and fatty acids in the process of lipolysis. The fatty acids can then be broken down directly to get energy, or can be used to make glucose through a multi-step process called gluconeogenesis. In gluconeogenesis, amino acids can also be used to make glucose. In the fat cell, other types of lipases work to break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. These lipases are activated by various hormones, such as glucagon, epinephrine and growth hormone. The resulting glycerol and fatty acids are released into the blood, and travel to the liver through the bloodstream. Once in the liver, the glycerol and fatty acids can be either further broken down or used to make glucose. <br> </br> <strong> Losing Weight and Losing Fat </strong> Your weight is determined by the rate at which you store energy from the food that you eat, and the rate at which you use that energy. Remember that as your body breaks down fat, the number of fat cells remains the same; each fat cell simply gets smaller. <br> </br> <strong> Most experts agree that the way to maintain a healthy weight is: </strong> <br> </br> Eat a balanced diet - appropriate amounts of carbohydrates, fat and protein <br> </br> Do not eat excessively - for most people, a diet of 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day is sufficient to maintain a healthy weight <br> </br> Exercise regularly"

    "body":            " ## <strong> How To Lose Fat: The One Absolute Requirement</strong> <br> </br> Simply put… a caloric deficit. That is the scientifically proven “secret” to losing fat. It literally can’t happen any other way. So just what is a caloric deficit? It’s what happens when you burn more calories than you consume (or consume less calories than you burn… just another way of saying the same thing). Basically, every single person has a unique calorie maintenance level. This is the amount of calories that your body requires each day to burn for energy to perform all of the tasks it needs to perform. From intense exercise like cardio and weight training, to simple daily tasks like brushing your teeth and getting dressed, to the various physiological functions needed to keep you alive (like digesting and breathing). Calories are what our bodies use for energy to do all of these things, and we provide these calories via the foods we eat. As a result, 3 things can happen… <br> </br> <strong> The 3 Calorie Intake Scenarios </strong> <br> </br> If we consume the SAME number of calories that our bodies need to burn each day, we will be at our maintenance level. Our weight will be maintained because all of the calories we needed were provided. No more, no less. <br> </br> If we exceed this amount and therefore consume MORE calories than our bodies need, all of the left over calories that weren’t burned will then be stored on our body in some form for later use. And guess what form it’s most often stored in? Yup… body fat! This is known as a caloric surplus, and it is the one and only cause of fat gain. <br> </br> But what we’re interested in is the opposite of this… a caloric deficit. This is what happens when we consume LESS than our maintenance level amount. What happens then is that our bodies are forced to find some other source of energy to burn instead. And guess what that source most often is? Yup… your own stored body fat! And this is the one and only cause of fat loss. So if you maintain your current weight eating 2500 calories per day (just an example), you will gain weight (mostly in the form of body fat) if you consumed 3000 calories per day. However, you would lose weight (mostly in the form of body fat) if you consumed 2000 calories per day. This all remains true regardless of what the source of those calories are (carbs, fat, protein, healthy, unhealthy, clean, dirty, processed, unprocessed… whatever) or when/how they were consumed (after 7pm, in 3 large meals, in 6 small meals, every 2 hours, every 5 hours, whatever). <br> </br> <strong> Exercise Can Play A Role, Too </strong> <br> </br> See how it works? These are the proven fundamentals of how to lose fat, and that was a simple example of how to create the required caloric deficit via your diet alone (by eating less calories). I mention this because that same deficit could have also been created via exercise (by burning more calories). Meaning, you could have still eaten 2500 calories for the day in the previous example, but then burned an additional 500 through exercise thus creating the same caloric deficit. Both scenarios would effectively cause fat loss, as would a third scenario where you did a combination of both (diet AND exercise). But no matter which way you choose to do it, one absolute requirement ALWAYS stands. In order to lose fat, you MUST create a caloric deficit. Nothing else works."

    "body":           "## <strong> HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING </strong> <br> </br> High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has become a popular way to burn more fat. It's a training method that has been effective for many people. <strong> WHAT IS HIIT? </strong> HIIT is a training idea in which low to moderate intensity intervals are alternated with high intensity intervals. HIIT can be applied to running or to exercises such as squatting. HIIT is considered to be much more effective than normal cardio because the intensity is higher and you are able to increase both your aerobic and anaerobic endurance while burning more fat than ever before.'In research, HIIT has been shown to burn adipose tissue more effectively than low-intensity exercise - up to 50% more efficiently.' It has also been shown to speed up your metabolism which helps you burn more calories throughout the day. (www.musclemedia.com) HIIT improves both energy systems for endurance: <br> </br> <strong> ANAEROBIC ENERGY SYSTEM </strong> Anaerobic literally means 'Without oxygen.' The anaerobic energy system is what provides energy in all out efforts of up to 1 minute. For the first 10-15 seconds, the phosphate pool is used up and after that, glycolysis and lactic acid are involved in the effort. During 10-15 second bursts, there is a very small amount of lactic acid produced. Rest periods of 30 seconds to a minute will provide complete recovery of the Adenosine Triphosphate-Creatine Phosphate (ATP-CP) system. During efforts of more than 10-15 seconds, a large amount of lactic acid is produced and such efforts are extremely taxing on both the athlete's muscles and their Central Nervous System (CNS). <br> </br> <strong> AEROBIC ENERGY SYSTEM </strong> Aerobic literally means 'with oxygen.' This energy system is utilized during prolonged exercise over a period of at least 3-4 minutes. As long as there is enough oxygen to provide energy, the fatigue that you experience will remain at a low level. This is the reason why many track and field athletes train at higher altitudes where there is less oxygen. By training at high altitudes, they can increase the number of red blood cells which will help them to perform for a longer period of time with little to no fatigue throughout."

    "body":           "## <strong> What Makes Muscle Grow? </strong> <br> </br> <strong> If you want to develop more muscle, then you better get ready to do some hard work and prepare for slow gains. Learn about resistance training, diet and rest. I'm sure that most people who have performed some form of resistance training have wanted to increase their muscle mass at one time or another. But the body is just naturally lazy and will only develop enough muscle to deal with the loads placed upon it. So, if you want to develop more muscle, then you better get ready to do some hard work and prepare for slow gains, for the body will only respond to a combination of resistance training, diet and rest. </strong> <br> </br> <strong> TWO FORMS OF GROWTH </strong> <br> </br> Muscle growth comes about because of hypertrophy or hyperplasia. Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of the muscle due to an increase in the size of the muscle fibers, while hyperplasia is an increase in the number of muscle fibers. Hypertrophy comes in two forms, sarcomere hypertrophy, an increase in the size of the contractile portion of the muscle; and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, an increase in the non-contractile portion of the muscle. Sarcomere hypertrophy involves a smaller increase in the diameter of the muscle, but muscle density increases. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy shows an increase in muscle diameter and a decrease in density. All hypertrophy will involve both processes; the ratio is dependent on training intensity and frequency. Heavy training on a regular basis will make you feel solid whereas someone who trains for the pump with light weights will feel soft. If you are interested in improving performance, than strive for sarcomere hypertrophy. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is only beneficial if an increase in body weight is more important than an improvement in performance. <br> </br> <strong> HYPERPLASIA AND WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW </strong> <br> </br> Hyperplasia is the splitting of muscle fibers, resulting eventually in a greater number of fibers the same size as the originals. It has been said that the number of muscle cells one is born with is all they will ever have, and the splitting is not new fibers but damage to existing fibers. Russian sports scientists claimed to find hyperplasia in swimmers' shoulders. Swimming is training at a high speed with low resistance. Other researchers have produced hyperplasia in chickens and grouse by hanging them by their wings for a few days. I do not know if hyperplasia is possible, but if you want to do a little experiment, I would train at high speed as opposed to hanging yourself in a stretched out position for the weekend. <br> </br> <strong> BREAKING DOWN </strong> <br> </br> The process of muscle growth is not known for sure, but most theories are based on the idea that lifting breaks down the muscle, and growth results from over-compensating to protect the body from future stress. The human body breaks down and rebuilds all of the muscles every 15 to 30 days. Lifting speeds up the process due to an increased need for fuel. Rebuilding peaks 24 to 36 hours after training and continues at increased rates for as much as 72 hours. The muscle hypoxia theory is that weight training decreases muscle oxygen content, and that triggers protein synthesis. It came from the fact that lifting loads over 60% of maximum temporarily cuts off blood flow. Restricting blood flow with a tourniquet does not result in muscle growth, and pearl divers are not overly muscular, so the muscle hypoxia theory can be thrown out. Another theory is that training increases blood flow and the increased nutrient supply is responsible for growth. It sounds good, but running increases blood flow and not too many distance runners have big legs. The ATP debt theory is that muscles use ATP contract, so ATP will break down and the waste products will trigger increased blood flow and growth. It has been discounted because ATP levels are the same following exercising to failure as at rest, and runners still do not have big legs. <br> </br> <strong> ENERGETIC THEORY </strong> <br> </br> The energetic theory that is currently the most accepted is that muscle has a certain amount of energy at any given time, for growth, repair, and movement. Soviet sport scientists have referred to this as an individual's current adaptive reserve. Over time, with a lot of hard work, the body becomes more efficient at breaking down and rebuilding muscle, which shows an increase in the current adaptive reserve. Increased energy supply allows more work to be accomplished, followed by increased growth."

    "publishedOn":        "2013-09-17",
    "body":          "## <strong> The Physiology Of Muscle Growth <strong> <br> </br> After you workout, your body repairs or replaces damaged muscle fibers through a cellular process where it fuses muscle fibers together to form new muscle protein strands or myofibrils. These repaired myofibrils increase in thickness and number to create muscle hypertrophy (growth).1 Muscle growth occurs whenever the rate of muscle protein synthesis is greater than the rate of muscle protein breakdown. This adaption, however, does not happen while you actually lift the weights. Instead, it occurs while you rest. So how do you actually add muscle to your muscle cells? This is where Satellite cells come in and act like stem cells for your muscles. When activated, they help to add more nuclie to the muscle cells and therefore contribute directly to the growth of myofibrils (muscle cells). Activating these satellite cells may be the difference between what allows certain “genetic freaks” to grow massive muscles and what makes other people “hard-gainers.2” In one of the most interesting studies in the past 5 years, researchers showed that those who were “extreme responders” to muscle growth, with an incredible 58% myofiber hypertrophy from an exercise, had 23% activation of their satellite cells. Modest responders, who had a 28% growth, had 19% activation of their satellite cells. What is interesting to note, though, is that some people known as “non-responders” in the study had 0% growth and had a concurrent 0% activation of their satellite cells. Therefore, it seems the more you can activate these satellite cells, the more you’ll be able to grow. So then the question becomes, how do you activate these satellite cells to increase muscle growth? <br> </br> <strong> 3 Mechanisms That Make Muscles Grow </strong> <br> </br> Underlying all progression of natural muscle growth is the ability to continually put more stress on the muscles. This stress is a major component involved in the growth of a muscle and disrupts homeostasis within your body. The stress and subsequent disruption in homeostasis causes three main mechanisms that spur on muscle growth. <br> </br> <strong> Muscle Growth Mechanism #1: Muscle Tension </strong> <br> </br> In order to produce muscle growth, you have to apply a load of stress greater than what your body or muscles had previously adapted too. How do you do this? The main way is to lift progressively heavier weights. This additional tension on the muscle helps to cause changes in the chemistry of the muscle, allowing for growth factors that include mTOR activation and satellite cell activation. Muscular tension also most dramatically effects the connection of the motor units with the muscle cells. Two other factors help to explain why some people can be stronger, but not as big as other people. <br> </br> <strong> Muscle Growth Mechanism #2: Muscle Damage  </strong> <br> </br> If you’ve ever felt sore after a workout, you have experienced the localized muscle damage from working out. This local muscle damage causes a release of inflammatory molecules and immune system cells that activate satellite cells to jump into action. This doesn’t mean that you have to feel sore in order for this to happen, but instead that the damage from the workout has to be present in your muscle cells. Typically soreness is attenuated over time by other mechanisms. <br> </br> <strong> Muscle Growth Mechanism #3: Metabolic Stress </strong> <br> </br> If you’ve ever felt the burn of an exercise or had the “pump” in the gym, then you’ve felt the effects of metabolic stress. Scientists used to question bodybuilders when they said the “pump” caused their muscles to become larger. After more investigation, it seems as though they were onto something. Metabolic stress causes cell swelling around the muscle, which helps to contribute to muscle growth without necessarily increasing the size of the muscle cells. This is from the addition of muscle glycogen, which helps to swell the muscle along with connective tissue growth. This type of growth is known as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and is one of the ways that people can get the appearance of larger muscles without increases in strength. So now that you know the three main mechanisms of muscle growth, the next question is: how do hormones affect muscle growth?"

    "body":          "## <strong> Maximize Muscle Building </strong> <br> </br> <strong> Eat Meat </strong> <br> </br> Shoot for about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, which is roughly the maximum amount your body can use in a day, according to a landmark study in the Journal of Applied Physiology. (For example, a 160-pound man should consume 160 grams of protein a day—the amount he'd get from an 8-ounce chicken breast, 1 cup of cottage cheese, a roast-beef sandwich, two eggs, a glass of milk, and 2 ounces of peanuts.) Split the rest of your daily calories equally between carbohydrates and fats. <strong> Eat More 1 </strong> <br> In addition to adequate protein, you need more calories. Use the following formula to calculate the number you need to take in daily to gain 1 pound a week. (Give yourself 2 weeks for results to show up on the bathroom scale. If you haven't gained by then, increase your calories by 500 a day.) A. Your weight in pounds. <br> B. Multiply A by 12 to get your basic calorie needs. <br> C. Multiply B by 1.6 to estimate your resting metabolic rate (calorie burn without factoring in exercise). <br> D. Strength training: Multiply the number of minutes you lift weights per week by 5. <br> E. Aerobic training: Multiply the number of minutes per week that you run, cycle, and play sports by 8. <br>F. Add D and E, and divide by 7. <br> G. Add C and F to get your daily calorie needs. <br> H. Add 500 to G. This is your estimated daily calorie needs to gain 1 pound a week. <br> <strong> Work Your Biggest Muscles </strong> <br> If you're a beginner, just about any workout will be intense enough to increase protein synthesis. But if you've been lifting for a while, you'll build the most muscle quickest if you focus on the large muscle groups, like the chest, back, and legs. Add squats, deadlifts, pullups, bent-over rows, bench presses, dips, and military presses to your workout. Do two or three sets of eight to 12 repetitions, with about 60 seconds' rest between sets. <strong> Have a Stiff Drink </strong> <br> A 2001 study at the University of Texas found that lifters who drank a shake containing amino acids and carbohydrates before working out increased their protein synthesis more than lifters who drank the same shake after exercising. The shake contained 6 grams of essential amino acids—the muscle-building blocks of protein—and 35 grams of carbohydrates. For your shake, you'll need about 20 grams of protein—usually about one scoop of a whey-protein powder. Can't stomach protein drinks? You can get the same nutrients from a sandwich made with 4 ounces of deli turkey and a slice of American cheese on whole wheat bread. But a drink is better. 'Liquid meals are absorbed faster,' says Kalman. So tough it out. Drink one 30 to 60 minutes before your workout. <strong> Lift Every Other Day </strong> <br> Do a full-body workout followed by a day of rest. Studies show that a challenging weight workout increases protein synthesis for up to 48 hours immediately after your exercise session. 'Your muscles grow when you're resting, not when you're working out,' says Michael Mejia, C.S.C.S., Men's Health exercise advisor and a former skinny guy who packed on 40 pounds of muscle using this very program. <strong> Down Carbs After Your Workout </strong> <br> Research shows that you'll rebuild muscle faster on your rest days if you feed your body carbohydrates. Post-workout meals with carbs increase your insulin levels, which, in turn, slows the rate of protein breakdown, says Kalman. Have a banana, a sports drink, a peanut-butter sandwich. <strong> Eat Every 3 Hours </strong> <br> 'If you don't eat often enough, you can limit the rate at which your body builds new proteins,' says Houston. Take the number of calories you need in a day and divide by six. That's roughly the number you should eat at each meal. Make sure you consume some protein—around 20 grams—every 3 hours. <strong> Make One Snack Ice Cream </strong> <br> Have a bowl of ice cream (any kind) 2 hours after your workout. According to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, this snack triggers a surge of insulin better than most foods do. And that'll put a damper on post-workout protein breakdown. <strong> Have Some Milk Before Bed </strong> <br> Eat a combination of carbohydrates and protein 30 minutes before you go to bed. The calories are more likely to stick with you during sleep and reduce protein breakdown in your muscles, says Kalman. Try a cup of raisin bran with a cup of skim milk or a cup of cottage cheese and a small bowl of fruit. Eat again as soon as you wake up. 'The more diligent you are, the better results you'll get,' says Kalman."

  "body": "<strong> Core Strength: The Ultimate Guide to Core Strength <strong> <br> <strong> CORE PRINCIPLES </strong> <br> The core is a collection of muscles which stabilize and move the spine. Close to the spine and deep inside the abdomen is the inner core, which is comprised of the diaphragm, pelvic floor, multifidi, deep cervical flexors, and transverse abdominus. These strange-sounding muscles engage first during movement or breathing to protect the spine. The outer core muscles are also responsible for stabilizing and protecting the spine, but they also have more defined movement functions. The anterior muscles (abdominals) are the most well-known members of the outer-core assembly. The lats, spinal erectors, glute complex, quadratus lumborum, and hip flexors are also outer-core muscles. If you want to get academic, you could make an argument that the core extends far beyond these muscles localized to the spine and hip complex. But for our current scope, the muscles I just mentioned nicely define the core. <br> <strong> SIMPLIFIED CORE STRENGTH </strong> <br> Purposeful core action requires understanding its function. The core stabilizes and protects the spine by creating stiffness that limits excessive movement in any direction—most notably extension, flexion, lateral flexion, and rotation. In lifting terms, the core's responsibility is to limit movement. Think about the core through the scope of strength exercises like the squat, deadlift, bench press, and overhead press. These movements require the spine to hold a rigid position so the hip and shoulder joints can move with force. The core muscles create the rigid spine position. To make the core stronger, you only need to let it do its job and protect the spine when you put heavy loads in your hands or on your shoulders. From this perspective, every exercise is a core exercise. Complete an exercise with good form and you trained the core to do its job. Consistently increase the load of an exercise using good form and you make the core stronger."

  "body":        "<strong> What is Core </strong> <br> If you’re newer to training or getting back into shape, I’m sure you’ve heard about core training. Perhaps you’ve heard about it in magazines or maybe your doctor recommended it. So, that’s all great and you want to start working on your core strength - but you have no idea where to start and you’re not exactly sure what the “core” really means. The core is a term used to describe just about everything on your body that isn’t your legs and arms. This means you can think of your glutes, hips, abdominal muscles, inner abdominal muscles, pelvic floor, and scapula as your core. Your core is where your power is generated in order to carry out any movement. While abdominal and inner abdominal muscles do play a large roll in core stability, they don’t make up the core all by themselves. + <img src = 'Images/Core/jpg'> + A mistake many people make is to think of their core as only being their abs, and because of this they go about training their core in many ineffective ways. Traditional ab exercises like crunches and sit ups are often used in hopes of achieving a stronger core and more defined abdominals, but this is a terrible method. Not only does performing endless crunches and sit ups not strengthen your core or give you more defined abs, it can be hazardous to your spine. Furthermore, crunches don’t work your abs in the way these muscles were designed to perform. The main function of the abdominals is to support the spine and prevent it from spinning all the way around, breaking over backward, or flexing to the side. The crunching movement is a secondary function and one that’s not meant to be done at high volume due to the stress it puts on the discs of your spine. In order to train the core effectively, we need to train all the muscles involved, starting slowly and building a foundation. These muscles need to work together as a team. Think of developing your core stability as pouring the concrete base for your home. This base provides structure and safety. It also cannot be rushed or overlooked. You wouldn’t build a home on soggy ground because your house would sink or fall apart. The same can be said for your body when it comes to developing your core."

  "body":           "<strong> What is so important about Core strength </strong> <br> Core Strength has been something of a buzz term recently, but I admit -- until yesterday, I wasn’t sure what the big deal was all about. Isn’t core training just a fancy way of saying toning your abs? Our moms used to simply call this doing sit-ups. But there’s way more to core training than the abdominals (and getting a flat tummy), says Dena Stern, personal trainer and managing editor of Exercise.com. I spoke with Stern yesterday about why core strength is so important -- and easy ways you can add more of it to your workout routine. <br> What exactly is core strength or core training? Core training does two really important things -- it helps you look thinner, and it supports your spine and helps with things like balance. I noticed when I started doing Pilates and a lot of core engagement that it got easier to snowboard, or do complicated yoga poses, also. Those core muscles ares connected to your legs, to the way you stand, squat, sit. It’s not just about the abdominal muscles, but also training your back, your glutes, and the entire area that connects to your spinal cord and helps your body support your spine, so that the burden of supporting your body weight isn’t just placed on your bones. The core is actually made up of three sheaths of muscles: The upper abs, the side muscles, which are called the obliques, and then this very deep layer of muscle. Those deep muscles are the ones that do all the good stuff, like support your spine and act as a natural corset—so when you work them not only do you get a flatter stomach but a tighter stomach. <br> What’s the difference between core training and working your abs? The difference between core and abdominal training is that you’re not just targeting the front side of the body but the back side as well. A core workout will also include the erector spinae, which are he muscles that make up your back, and also your glutes. A movement that works your core is going to work more than one muscle group, and you’re going to see results a lot faster. So are crunches useless? Crunches are really important, because before you can engage your deeper core, you need that strength in your abdominal muscles. You have to build that strength, and doing crunches is a great way for somebody to build up, to work towards getting a stronger core. I think crunches are boring, and people hate them, so the idea of doing a lot of crunches doesn’t get people excited about exercise. Given a minute, I can think of four exercises other than crunches with no equipment that would give you results faster. But there are ways to make a crunch more challenging. Introducing instability is one of my favorites. Doing a crunch on a ball, or a foam roller, your body is going to be balancing so you won’t just be working the abs, you’ll be stabilizing the core. There’s no such thing as a bad exercise -- my personal opinion is anything you like enough to do is good. I like to do crunches when I’m sitting home watching TV, instead of reaching for the chips. What’s important about a crunch is doing it correctly -- drawing your belly button toward your spine, moving your ribs toward your hips, moving your shoulders up to you chest -- but its a small movement. That movement should be incredibly challenging, and it doesn’t get easier. If you do it with mind-fullness, it can be a challenging exercise. <br> Why does core strength matter so much, anyway? This is one of my favorite topics! The reason I became an advocate for core-training was my mother. We’re both kind of top-heavy women, and after 50 years supporting the weight of her own body, she starting having bone spurs poking out of her spine. She had to get a very serious surgery. And her doctor told her, You have a daughter, right? Tell her she should start working her core now, because it’s so much easier to build core strength now and just keep it up as you get older. It’s not just about looking good in a bikini -- core training is something I can do to take care of my body as I age, you know? I sit at a desk at a computer all day, 12 hours a day, and this is a way that I can keep myself from having horrible back pain as I age. <br> What are the best workouts for building core strength? If people want to really improve their core strength, introducing instability into workouts they’re already doing and Pilates are both really great ways. I love Pilates. If you’re looking for one exercise that does get results in your core, definitely Pilates. I do exercise that are a mix of Pilates and yoga -- doing a plank or a superman or Hundreds, you’re forcing the muscles to work together, instead of just isolating a specific muscle like you do in strength training. I would also say any exercise you do on a Bosu -- it’s like half of an exercise ball on a flat black surface, and they’re fantastic. When I do squats, I do them on a Bosu -- just flip it over and do it on the back side. Or I’ll do lunges with one foot on the Bosu. It engages your core, because you have to stabilize yourself on that surface. Try introducing instability into every exercise you do."

  "body":           "<strong> 7 Ways to boost your endurance and stamina </strong> <br> </br> 1. Combine strength days with cardio days. <br> It’s a simple equation: the more muscle you can get working, the more it will challenge your heart and your cardiovascular system. Instead of building cardio-only workouts (the pitfall that’ll prevent you from building endurance) make sure to weave strength days into your training. Most people reserve one day for strength and another day for cardio. Try combining the two instead, says Torres. Use a bench press, immediately followed by pull-ups, then run a mile as fast as you can… and repeat. Another good example: Jump rope for a minute, followed by squats, an overhead press, and finally sit ups. Repeat. <br> 2. Reduce your amount of rest. <br> Men typically give themselves between 30 and 90 seconds of recovery time in between sets, but if your goal is greater endurance, be prepared to sacrifice break time. By the end of your sets, your muscles should be burning—you should be breathing heavily and sweating, says Torres. Only take a break if you physically can not continue. Torres suggests selecting a series of movements like 10 pull-ups, 10 squats, 10 push-ups, 10 sit-ups. Do three rounds of the series back to back, taking as minimal a break as possible. <br> 3. Do fast-paced, high-intensity lifting. <br> When you use weights at an extremely rapid pace, it will not only improve your strength, but also carry over to improve your endurance activity,” says Torres. “It’s one of the best ways to ignite your metabolism. When people do an excessive amount of endurance-only training, they actually slow down their metabolism because it starts to eat away at your muscle tissue. <br> 4. Choose compound movements over isolation. <br> Compound moves that require using more than one joint—like squats, step-ups, push-ups and pull-ups—will improve your endurance more so than exercises in isolation. Isolated exercises like bicep curls and leg lifts aren’t going to stimulate you enough to increase your stamina, he says. <br> 5. Remember: Routine is the enemy. <br> Switching up your workout is essential to building endurance and stamina. According to Torres, the human body gets used to a workout after two weeks. So if you’re always running, start doing Muay Thai instead. Or if you’re an avid cyclist, change it up by running stairs. You need to move the muscles in a different way so that you don’t develop overuse. Plus, it becomes more motivating,” he says. It’s important to keep the mind guessing. <br> 6. Go for hybrid exercises. <br> A squat with an added overhead press (a thruster), jumping pull-ups, and lunges with bicep curls are all great hybrids: exercises that take two separate movements and combine them. The more muscles you can get working in a movement, the more it will stimulate your heart muscles, which in turn improves your stamina. <br> 7. Add explosive movements to your workout. <br> Explosive movements that take a lot of energy challenge your strength, endurance and stamina simultaneously. Once you become more explosive, you’ll notice that you’ll actually start moving faster. Torres says: try adding things like burpees, box jumps, jumping knee tucks and power push-ups to your workout routine."

  "body":           "Do you have a hard time catching your breath after taking the stairs? You may need to build your cardiovascular endurance. Stamina is our ability to sustain prolonged activity. We live in a sedentary society. Elevators help you avoid the stairs. Valets prevent you from having to walk from your car. Aerobic or endurance activities improve the heart’s ability to circulate oxygenated blood and the body’s ability to use oxygen, states Harvard Medical School. Fortunately you can increase your cardio stamina by following a simple workout routine. <br> Assess your current level of stamina. Try running or walking for one mile and record your time. Repeat on a weekly basis. Aim to increase your speed and lower your time every week. Perform slow long distance cardio. Jog or walk for 60 minutes twice per week at a low intensity. Gauge your intensity by using the talk test. You should be able to hold a conversation without being too winded. According to Sports Fitness Advisor, this form of aerobic endurance training improved cardiovascular and thermoregulatory function, improved mitochondrial energy production, increased oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle and increased utilization of fat for fuel. <br> Try circuit training. Circuit training involves planning eight to 10 different activities and then performing each activity for one to three minutes before moving on to the next. Set your dumbbells at one end of the room, your kettlebells or resistance bands at another and your aerobic step platform at another. Your elliptical or rowing machine can also act as stations, if you have them. Perform cardio activities like running on the spot and jumping jacks in between activities that require equipment. Because there is little to no rest in between exercises, your heart rate stays elevated for the entire workout improving cardiovascular health. Take the assessment in Step 1 to chart your progress after executing this program for 30 days. You can build cardiovascular stamina fairly quickly; but if you have not exercised for awhile, start by taking short, brisk walks. A 15 minute fast walk every night for a week will get you used to the effort it requires to perform aerobic exercise. It's better to ease into a workout program than quit because it's too much for you at the beginning."

  "publishedOn":        "2012-12-16",
  "body":          "<strong> What is Cardiovascular Endurance? </strong> <br> Cardiovascular endurance is the ability of the heart, lungs and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to your body tissues. The more efficiently your body delivers oxygen to its tissues, the lower your breathing rate is. While this may help you get a little more bottom time from each tank of air, the real benefits are being more relaxed during each dive, experiencing less fatigue and being better able to respond to challenging currents, long swims and any emergencies that may arise. Essentially, a stronger, more efficient oxygen delivery system allows you to dive with greater ease in any situation. The good news is that you can improve your cardiovascular endurance through a sensible program of regular aerobic exercise performed within a target range of 60 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate (MHR). Most people see significant improvement in about three months as the heart muscle grows stronger and pumps more blood with each beat. Blood vessels become more elastic, reducing blood pressure, and capillaries — the tiny vessels that actually deliver oxygen to your tissues — create more branches. Oxygen is taken up by the tissues more effectively as the density of oxygen receptors (called mitochondria) increases. The net result is a positive effect on overall health and wellness. <br> Resting Heart Rage: An Indicator of Cardiovascular Endurance <br> Your resting heart rate (RHR) is both a reliable indicator of cardiovascular endurance and the baseline measurement for monitoring your aerobic workouts. An untrained individual has an RHR of approximately 70 beats per minute (bpm), while an elite athlete like Lance Armstrong may have an RHR of approximately 35 bpm. A healthy goal is around 65 bpm. Try measuring your RHR on three separate occasions; multiple attempts minimize any impact of nervousness or technique. If you discover an RHR above 80 bpm, see a physician before beginning a cardiovascular training program. Your RHR can be determined by taking your pulse (radial or carotid) first thing in the morning before you get out of bed, ideally after a good night's sleep. Count beats for 30 seconds and multiply by two to determine beats per minute. Repeat the process over several days, and take the average as your true RHR. Check for accuracy by comparing your count to a heart rate monitor or by having a partner count, too; have him or her count your radial while you count your carotid pulse, and see if you get the same result. <br> The FITT Principles <br> Once you know your RHR, it's time to build an aerobic exercise regimen. An effective workout is a balance between frequency, intensity, type and time (FITT). FITT principles will help you manage your fitness plan, but always listen to your body to achieve an appropriate balance. An aerobic training program is supposed to decrease stress levels, not increase them. <br> Frequency <br> The American College of Sports Medicine currently recommends that healthy adults participate in moderate aerobic exercise 30 minutes a day, five days a week, or vigorous cardio exercise 20 minutes a day, three days per week. Follow these guidelines, and you should start feeling the results within the first few days. Unfortunately, detraining also occurs quickly, so it is important to make sure there are no more than two days of rest between cardio workouts. Although these guidelines are ideal, remember that any exercise is better than no exercise. If you can squeeze in even 5-10 minutes, it will help to maintain your current fitness level. <br> Intensity <br> Cardiovascular endurance improves when you exercise in an aerobic training zone that elevates your heart rate to somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of your maximum heart rate. To find your MHR, subtract your age from 220. Your true MHR should fall within 12 beats above or below this number. Then use these formulas to find the upper and lower range: <br> Aerobic Training Zone <br> ((MHR - RHR) × .60) + RHR = Lower Limit of Range <br> ((MHR - RHR) × .85)+ RHR = Upper Limit of Range <br> Shorter workouts will be closer to the upper limit, while longer workouts will be closer to the lower limit. Interval training, which alternates bursts of vigorous and moderate intensity, has a greater impact in a shorter time. Use the low-intensity range for a warm-up, then begin with a 1:1 work/rest ratio. For example: Follow 30 seconds of activity with 30 seconds of recovery. There are countless variations of intensity levels depending on the duration of your workout, work/rest ratios and where you want to be within the lower or upper limits of each training zone. <br> Type <br> Common aerobic activities include walking, jogging, swimming, cycling and stair climbing, but it doesn't matter what type of exercise you choose as long as you stay in your training zone. Choose aerobic activities that you enjoy and can realistically fit into your daily routine. Consider mixing activities to alleviate boredom, work different muscle groups and avoid overuse injuries. Strength training can also meet cardiovascular needs if you minimize or eliminate the waiting time between exercises and keep your heart rate elevated. The push-pull structure of the strength training workouts in the last three Dive Fitness columns allow you to improve cardiovascular endurance while improving muscle strength. <br> Time <br> Time is the duration of a given workout. Your goal should be a minimum of 30 minutes in your target range (20 minutes for interval training) per workout. If you're having trouble reaching that at first, take baby steps. Start with accumulating 30 minutes in your target range over the course of a day; try 10 minutes before breakfast, 10 minutes before lunch and 10 minutes before dinner. Keep your heart rate up for a little while today and a little longer tomorrow. Once you've established an aerobic workout routine, stick with it. If time is tight, shorten your workout but increase the intensity. If you are tired before you start, plan for a less intense workout, but extend the time. Above all, be realistic with your goals, and remember this is a program for life."

  "body":          "<strong> Seven Basketball Tips For Young Players </strong> <br> </br> 1. All Great Players Are Great Athletes <br> The most important thing you can do to improve your game is to become a good athlete. The stronger and faster you are, the better you will play. Achieve this goal through conditioning and weight training. Have a physical check-up by your doctor before you start training .Conditioning is easy. Start with 15 minutes of continuous motion, either jogging or, even better, running full court with the ball. Dribble, shoot, and rebound as usual; don't stop moving for the time allotted. You do not need to move quickly. After a week or two of conditioning you will find a comfortable pace. Then, increase the time you spend in the activity according to your performance. Do this every day. Increase moving time about five minutes a week after the first two-four weeks. Weight training is very helpful. However, there is some disagreement on what age a child can start. One theory says that a build up of muscle mass while bones are growing can limit growth. Some tall body builders disagree, and use themselves as an example to the contrary. Make sure you are well supervised and get advice if you weight train.Any physical education teacher and most coaches can show you how to do push ups, sit-ups, and other various strengthening exercises. Twenty minutes of instruction will reap great rewards. Remember that you always must underdo these exercises at first so that you can find your level. Underdoing means that you put out a minimum of effort. Do as few as possible, rather than exercise to exhaustion. (The no pain, no gain philosophy definitely doesn't work for beginners. I question whether or not this approach works for athletes in good shape.) This approach prevents injury. Don't forget stretching. Stretching permits you to have a more full range of motion allowing you to twist and turn more readily. You will even run faster. Any physical education teacher or coach can give you tons of stretching exercises. Make sure to warm-up before stretching and always hold the position, never move back and forth. <br> 2. You Can't Shoot Properly Unless You Hold The Ball Correctly </br> The most difficult skills, including shooting, passing, catching, dribbling, and rebounding, involve holding the ball. There are many signs of faulty ball handling: dropping passes; spraining and jamming fingers; palming the ball; rebounding poorly, shooting poorly. I can't overemphasize the importance of working on this skill daily.Here is how to practice holding the ball: 1. Make both hands into claws. Growl like a lion and move the claws forward like you are going to rip something apart. 2. Make sure your fingers are far apart. 3. Put the ball between the claws and hold the ball securely. Your only contact with the ball should be your finger ends, not the pads. The palm and other parts of the hand do not touch the ball. Overdoing the hold this way is most beneficial. 4. Hold the ball as long as possible at home while watching TV or listening to the radio. Before practice, hold the ball for a minute or two and at every other opportunity. <br> 3. Use Your Wrists In Shooting, Passing, and Dribbling <br> The wrist skills, which include shooting, passing, and dribbling, involve the motion of the hand and wrist. Waving good-bye is an example of wrist motion that needs to be practiced. This rarely practiced motion reaps incredible benefits. Not only will you improve, but you will permanently improve.Here is how to practice: 1. While standing, put your arms straight up overhead, palms facing forward. Keep your elbows straight and do not move your arms throughout the exercise. 2. With your hands slightly clawed, flick your wrist backward and let it come forward without additional effort. Continue to flick your wrists backward. You are doing this correctly if your hand and wrist go back and forth like a wet noodle. Make sure to keep your hands in a slightly clawed position. 3. Continue doing this for one to two minutes. Initially this motion will be very difficult. 4. This first part of the exercise helps with shooting and passing. For help with dribbling, lower the arms to the side with the palms facing backward. 5. With elbows straight and arms stationary, flick the wrist forward and let it come back without effort. Continue doing this for one-two minutes. Make sure the hand is slightly clawed. 6. Do these exercises as often as possible. Make them part of your normal practice warm-up. The more difficult this exercise is to do, the more you need it. It may take one month or more to properly do these exercises. <br> 4. Pivoting Is A Key To Many Other Skills <br> Many players and coaches underestimate the importance of pivoting. Every movement with the ball initially involves pivoting. Players routinely pivot to shoot or pass. What is not so obvious is that all moves, most fakes, and driving to the basket all depend on the ability to pivot. Poor pivoters do not have moves and cannot drive well to the basket.You must be able to pivot forward and backward using either foot. So each exercise must be repeated four times: left foot forward; left foot backward; right foot forward; right foot backward.The pivot foot is the foot that stays in place. Actually only one part of the foot, the ball of the foot, stays stationary. As you turn, the rest of the foot rotates about the ball of the foot. If you slide or change your pivot point after you have the ball, officials call a walking violation. Your team loses the ball. Here is how to practice pivoting: 1. Start with the left foot as pivot foot. If you have a ball, hold it in the exaggerated claw position during this exercise. 2. Pivot forward 15 times like you are stomping on bugs as you go. As you find your balance, increase the rotation to a half turn. 3. Repeat rotating backward 15 times. 4. Switch pivot foot. Repeat forward 15 times. 5. Repeat backward 15 times. Have a bystander or friend watch for several things. You must keep your head up like you would in a game. Your pivot point must not change. Your pivot foot does not slide. <br> 5. Defense Is Easy To Learn <br> Your stance for defense and dribbling is very similar. In both positions you need to be ready to run full speed in any direction. Tap dancing on your toes while in position helps you to practice tap dancing. How to get in position: 1. In a standing position, move your feet to slightly greater than shoulder width apart. 2. Bend your knees, keeping your back straight and vertical, not bent, till you are down as far as you can go. Then come halfway up. 3. Move the arms slightly outward from the shoulders and move the forearms parallel to the ground. 4. The hands should be slightly clawed in what I call the ready position. What to do in position: 5. Tap dance byquickly bringing the knees slightly up (one-two inches) and down one at a time. 6. Count to 20, one tap at a time.7. Then sprint four steps forward. Tap and count to 20 again.8. Pivot around and sprint four steps backwards. Face the original direction, and tap and count to 20 again.9. Continue for five minutes, moving back and forth and then left and right.<br> 6. Practice shooting from one foot, rather than from greater distances. Unless you shoot with the proper technique, practicing from great distances distorts your shot. Improper practice makes your shot worse. So, practice from one foot while you develop your shot.Here is how to practice:Take 10 one foot shots from the right side of the basket, then 10 from the left, and then 10 from the center. Use the backboard from all three positions. You can repeat this many times.<br> 7. Play full court rather than half court <br>Half-court street basketball is very different from full court ball. Here are some problems associated with half court ball:• Half court does not have a transition from one basket to the other. Starting a play half court and starting one full court is very different.• In half court games you do not need to run full speed for great distances. In full court games, you must perform out of breathe after sprinting down court three or four times.• Players congregate closer to the basket in half court than in full court, yielding more three second violations.• In half court you are so close to the basket that players readily go one-on-one, rather than play team ball.• In half court you have a greater chance for injury: since players must make many direction changes in a small crowded area."

Lower yourself down halfway to the ground. Violently explode off the floor and catch and stabilize yourself on your basketball and hold for a one count. Toss yourself off and land softly on the floor. Repeat for desired repetitions. <br> <strong> Medicine Ball Wall Throws </strong> <br> This drill is great for hand-eye coordination, and the nature of the motions will dramatically improve your ability to pass, catch and control the basketball. That will drastically transfer to more precise passing and catching abilities on the court along with your new greater sense of power. <br> How to Perform It: <br> Face a wall with a medicine ball in your hands around chest height. Violently fire the medicine ball at a predetermined target at the wall. Have your hands out in front of you ready to absorb the rebound of the ball off the wall. Catch the ball. Fire it back at the wall for desired repetitions or time. <br> <strong> Medicine Ball Rotational Side Wall Throws </strong> <br> This drill is another great power exercise that every basketball player should learn to perform. I love it because just like all the previous exercises, it improves your hand-eye coordination, which is vital to becoming a successful basketball player. It also dramatically improves your body core strength, and ability to explosively change direction. Talk about a bang-for-your-buck exercise. <br> How to Perform It: <br> Stand in an athletic stance with your feet shoulder-width apart facing the wall sideways. Hold the medicine ball with both hands and arms only slightly bent on the side of your hip farthest away from the wall. Swing ball over to your hip and violently toss the ball underhand and forward against the wall. Have your hands up and ready to receive the rebound of the ball back to you. Catch ball on the bounce from your wall and make sure that you repeat it again and again. Make sure you work on the drills with both sides of your body. <br> <strong> Medicine Ball Slams </strong> <br> Medicine ball slams are a tremendous upper-body strength and power builder for basketball player. This exercise is great because it can be done in a relative small area of space, it improves your sports performance, and players really enjoy doing it. <br> How to Perform It: <br> Stand in an athletic stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and the medicine ball tucked behind your head. Explosively and forcefully slam the medicine ball into the ground as hard as you can. Squat down and pick up the medicine ball and repeat for desired repetitions. <br> <strong> Medicine Ball Squat Throws <br> <strong> Of all the great basketball explosion exercises, squat throws is by far my favorite exercise. I like this exercise because it teaches you how to transfer the energy from the ground and explosively release it through your hands. Many players have trouble mastering this concept, but after regularly performing this exercise, they become much more explosive from head to toe. <br> How to Perform It: <br> Stand in an athletic stance with your feet shoulder-width apart while you are holding a medicine ball and chest level. Quickly squat down to parallel Explosively jump straight up and explode the medicine ball above your head as high as you can. Let the medicine ball drop to the ground, pick it up and repeat steps 1-3 for desired reps."

  "body":           "<strong> Basketball Skills – 7 Ways To Improve Yours </strong> <br> It’s important for a young basketball player to spend timebasketball skills practice improving his or her basketball skills. To many players there is nothing more exciting than finding new ways to improve their game. In addition to Triple Threat Academy’s camps and trainings it’s always fun and exciting for players to find other ways to improve their game. They know that it can give them an edge on their competitors and could be exactly what they need to start the next season off right. With some hard work on improving their basketball skills in the off season, they may get more time on the court, better numbers in the stat sheet, and more accolades at season’s end. Here are seven of the best ways to build on what you learn at Triple Threat Academy camps and improve your game. <br> Play Games Out of Season <br> There are a lot of opportunities for youngsters to play in games before the season ends. Teenagers can look for AAU leagues to join, and for those who want a less serious commitment, there are summer leagues in most major US cities. In addition to AAU and summer leagues, most schools have open gyms where you can get some extra time on the court not just out of season, but in-season as well. As important as it is to work on detailed skills in the offseason, it’s also important to incorporate those skills at game speed, so staying sharp with off-season games is a great way to keep your skills sharp. <br> Practice Chair Drills <br> Lots of kids who are dedicated to playing basketball find that it’s hard to find other kids who will keep up with their passion. In the summer, or after practice, most kids want to go to the mall, play video games, or just hang out. For the kid that wants to keep playing basketball, chair drills can be extremely handy as a substitute for another player. Set up stacks of chairs on a court, and use them to practice dribbling and shooting drills. The chairs can simulate the size of a player, and force you to keep your head up and navigate around them while maintaining speed and focus. <br> Focus on Strength and Conditioning <br> Most players start the season a little bit out of shape and out of practice. A kid who spends the summer and fall conditioning will be leaps ahead of his or her teammates when the season starts. Strength workouts are key for keeping fighting fit in the off season, as they can help players build muscles that are greatly helpful for basketball skills. <br> Eat Right <br> While just about everyone loves to chow down on junk food, those looking to improve their basketball skills would do better to stick to healthy snacks to give their game an edge. Kids, parents and coaches alike can read a book or two about nutrition, and incorporate what they learn into their training. A proper diet gives a young player superior energy and strength, which will show on the court. <br> Get Plenty of Sleep <br> Most kids don’t want to hear this, but getting enough sleep can be the difference between being sluggish on the court and running laps around the competition. Kids who get at least eight hours of sleep a night have far more energy when they lace up their shoes and hit the court. <br> Set Shooting Goals <br> The best way to improve your jump shot is through repetition; as with so many things, practice makes perfect. However, repetition can get a little flat and boring without setting some goals. Set a goal for every day: something such as 150 jumpers from three different spots, or 200 made free throws. Then try to hit that goal every day – that will keep players hot out of season, and give them a huge edge when practice starts up again. <br> Try Multiple Ball and Tennis Ball Drills <br> The best way to improve basketball-related hand-eye coordination is running these two drills: practice dribbling two basketballs at once, and then practice dribbling one basketball with one hand, while catching tennis balls from a friend or parent with the other hand. Your ball skills will improve dramatically as you are forced to multitask and your hand-eye coordination improves. With these methods, any young player can experience a dramatic improvement in his or her basketball skills and what they bring to the game."

  "category":        "Athletics",
  "author":        "Vincent Matarrese",
  "authorUrl":     "http://www.upgradedslugger.com/blog/25-ways-to-improve-your-baseball-game",
  "publishedOn":        "2015-04-17",
  "body":           "<strong> 25 Ways To Improve Your Baseball Game </strong> <br> </br> <br> 1 - START A BASEBALL JOURNAL <br> With today's technology many professional baseball players keep an electronic journal of their at-bats with notes for each pitcher. For you this may no be an option so I suggest keeping a physical or electronic journal of mechanical fixes your working on, mindset tendencies and to review your at-bats. The purpose is to think and breakdown your performance outside of the game or practice then record so you can build on past ideas or reference experiences. <br> 2 - COMPLETE A DAILY MOBILITY ROUTINE <br> First, mobility and flexibility are two different things. What mobility work focuses on is ensuring that muscle, fascia and other tissue is free of knots and tight spots that will restrict movement. The most popular mobility method uses self-massage with foam roller, lacrosse ball (baseball and softballs will work) and band assistance. For more information I recommend checking out Dr. Kelly Starrett and his mobilitywod project on Youtube or on mobilitywod.com. Also, read his book Becoming a Supple Leopard <br> 3 - IMPLEMENT A POST PRACTICE AND GAME COOL DOWN <br> This might be the most overlooked part of your training and performance regiment. After practice and games you MUST cool down to prevent injury and increase your bodies ability to recover. (Don't believe me check out the Guide to Sports Medicine) Finishing a practice or training session then going home is like going 70 on the freeway then turning your engine off! What to do? It's quick and easy, complete (3) rounds of an easy jog for 2 minutes, then 10 squats and 10 push ups followed by a few simple stretches. <br> 4 - DEVELOP AND RECORD PITCH COUNT MINDSETS <br> Many times players will have inconsistent pitch count mindsets which leave them thinking and questioning themselves during at-bats. Determine your mindset before the game starts so that during the game you can avoid any doubts. To do this know what your strengths and weaknesses are such as if you perform better when guessing pitches or when you are simply seeing the ball. If you perform better when thoughtless then keep it simple, even or ahead in the count focus on attacking while behind in the count focus on relaxing and surviving to see another pitch. Whatever you do, have a plan set so you do not question yourself during competition. I know that strategies change based on the pitcher's game but your mindset should be set. <br> 5 - IDENTIFY YOUR GOAT AND WORK IT EVERYDAY <br> To begin, your GOAT is the biggest weakness or deficiency in your game. It could be breaking balls, panicking with two strikes, inside fastballs, etc. Once you have identified this limiting factor, spend 10-15 minutes everyday working on improving it. After a few weeks you will notice a huge difference IF you are practicing effectively. <br> 6 - STEP UP YOUR MENTAL TOUGHNESS <br> It is no coincidence that top performers from every field, not just sports, are mentally tough and gritty. To play at the next level you will have to develop a higher level of toughness or you will crumble under the pressures of competition. The best way to improve your mental toughness is by completing challenges. For details check out this post on getting tougher. <br> 7 - BE THE LEADER EVERY TEAM NEEDS <br> Leadership in sports and the work place is a crucial trait to have. In baseball I view leadership skills as a multiplier to your physical skills. The best part about being a leader is that there are many ways to express leadership skills and it only takes a little work to get start. For details check out this post on becoming your own leader. <br> 8 - GET YOUR NUTRITION IN ORDER <br> If you are an athlete it's time to start treating food as fuel instead of purely pleasure. The obvious reason is to improve body composition for athletic performance. If you are looking to drop some fat weight then start with a food log and change your regularly consumed foods. Here is a good start (Click Here). Another reason to cut out the junk food (stop BS'ing yourself, you know what junk food is) is that excessive sugar consumption is linked to weaker cognitive function, processing speed and short term memory recollection (see Diet and Exercise in Cognitive Function and Neurological Diseases By Akhlaq A. Farooqui, Tahira Farooqu.). Cognitive function is linked to feeling in the zone so eat what will maximize your brain function. During athletic events, cognitive performance is VERY IMPORTANT! <br> 9 - VIDEO RECORD AND STUDY YOUR SWING <br> There is no excuse for not consistently video recording your swing and reviewing with a trusted coach or comparing with a major leaguerer. If you don't know what to look for check out these articles that detail mechanical positions <br> 10 - OBSESSIVELY WATCH VIDEO OF YOUR FAVORITE PLAYER <br> Growing up my parents didn't have cable so there was never any baseball for me to watch. Luckily, my grandparents would VHS record New York Mets games and mail the tape to me if Mike Piazza had a good game. I would watch his home run swings dozens of times then go outside and try to replicate what I saw. I can still picture his swing perfectly. Research shows that we can learn skills from watching something repetitively, so go find video of your favorite player and watch it everyday. Pay attention to joint angles, timing and rhyme. Check out The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle for more info into learning by visual aids.v <br> 11 - PRACTICE SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS <br> There is a great quote that I first heard from Vinny Rottino (profile), In baseball you must keep your highs low, and lows high. I don't know if he made that up himself but it is something I remind myself of all the time. In baseball huge performances bring the risk of over inflating your confidence and ego, while terrible games can lead to a prolonged hitting drought (I don't say the 's' word). To practice short term memory loss just sit alone and listen to a relaxing song. While that song plays recall what happened during your previous game, accept the outcomes and then discard it from your memory. When the song ends so does your recollection of the game. <br> 12 - SPEND TIME WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE <br> You are the average of the FIVE people you spend the most time with. I don't know where this statement comes from but I know it is absolutely true. Change who you are spending time with, seek out players who work harder than you or anyone who is focused on greatness. Most importantly cut the out the losers! It may be hard to understand if you are in high school but you must get rid of the losers who have no focus. What's more important, realizing your dreams or hurting someone's feelings? I know that sounds like an A-hole statement but realizing goals is not always a nice. <br> 13 - SLEEP FOR PERFORMANCE <br> Have the discipline to go to bed early and wake up early. Nothing happens late at night that will help your performance the next day. Sure you may have fun with your friends or meet some girls but are these things more important than resting to reach your baseball dreams? Maybe they are more important, in that case your dreams will most likely not become reality. <br> 14 - HAVE GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION <br> Why is practicing gratitude and appreciation important? Ask any of your baseball coaches who don't play anymore, or ask some parents, almost all of them will tell you their baseball careers went by incredibly fast and they would do anything to play again. Being grateful for your health, opportunities and situation is the BEST way to stay relaxed, forget bad performances and clear your mind. It just so happens that these things will also help you perform better. Practice this will driving to the diamond or when stretching. <br> 15 - ASK FOR HELP <br> It always amazes me how few players will actually ask a coach for some one-on-one help. During the baseball season there is little time for coaches to work individually when the entire team is present. Ask to work before or after with a trusted coach, which leads to the next tip... <br> 16 - BE THE FIRST PERSON TO THE DIAMOND <br> There are three main reasons why I feel being first to the diamond is important. First, getting to the diamond early for game day gives you ample time to forget all the other stuff that is going on in your life and relax. Second, lend a hand to whoever prepares the diamond for the game. Cutting the grass, striping the lines or fixing the batter's box will bring you a better appreciation for the game. Third, before teammates arrive you will have time to work on your weaknesses and seek one-on-one help from a coach. <br> 17 - PRACTICE DEEP BREATHING <br> <br> Deep diaphragm breathing is the best way to reduce your heart rate, relax and focus. Pay attention to the next MLB game you watch and you'll see all the deep breaths that players take between pitches. Use deep breathing to slow down heart rate in pressure game situations. <br> 18 - STOP USING THE 'S' WORD <br> I absolutely despise the word that rhymes with clump which is also freely thrown around by players of all ages and levels. The reason why I never use it or even say it is because once you define your current performance state with that word, you have an excuse for further bad performance. If you strikeout or line out, Oh well I'm in a S****. Not only do you see everything through the lens of the 's' word but you also make it incredibly difficult to forget past performances once you define yourself this way. So join me in forgetting about that word entirely. <br> 19 - IN-SEASON STRENGTH TRAINING IS A MUST <br> Strength training in-season is a must that every athlete should be doing to MAINTAIN strength throughout the season. What should you be doing? Keep it simple by completing simple lifts and movements at 65%-75% of your max. A good program is five sets of five with 65% of max. Get into the weight room a few times a week or simple knock out push ups, pull ups, lunges and squats at home. You will lose a lot of strength if you go 4-5 months without training. <br> 20 - ADDITION BY SUBTRACTION <br> In-season or out of season, it is important to be at your physical best especially with so many show cases available 12 months a year. For those that are strength and endurance training, you may gain the most by avoiding a few errors. What you want to avoid is anything that is leaving you weak (slow endurance training), stiff and immobile (body building) or just plain training something that doesn't apply to baseball movements.<br> 21- MOTIVATE YOURSELF FOR 30 MINUTES EACH DAY <br>This may be the easiest tip to implement. Every morning when you wake up read or watch motivational material. Here are some of my favorites: Tony Robbins, Eric Thomas, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Elliott Hulse, Les Brown, Joe Rogan, Nick Vujicic and don't forget clips from Rocky!<br> 22 - PRACTICE YOUR TIMING <br>The greatest swing mechanics and mindset will bring you zero success without pitch timing. The best way to work on having good timing in the game is to mimic the cadence and rhythm of a game when you are hitting on a tee, doing front toss and finally BP. Specifically what you are practicing is the breathing, load, slight pause, swing and contact that is identical to a well hit ball from a pitcher. This may be confusing so think back to when you were hitting great and the baseball looked like a beach ball. Every time you felt this way hitting and then proceeded to barrel the ball, you were experiencing GOOD timing. Now, think about when you are hitting poorly and the ball feels like an aspirin. This is bad timing. Practicing good timing is first visualizing it then following that rhythm whenever hitting. Stop rushing your tee and bp swings!<br> 23 - RECITE YOUR GOALS (YOU BETTER HAVE THEM WRITTEN DOWN ALREADY!) <br> One of my all time favorite books is Think Big and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. I've mentioned this book many times before but basically what he instructs is to write down your goals and read it to yourself with emotion twice a day. First thing when you wake up read your goals, stretch and motivate yourself. Before bed read your goals and visualize success tomorrow.<br> 24 - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND FAIL <br>One experience that all successful people have had is failure. Failure is something to be grateful for because it gives you the most to learn from and grow (Click Here for more failure lessons). To improve your game seek out any baseball experience with players from a higher level. One thing that I am constantly trying to do with my young catchers is to have them catch a bullpen from a much older player. If a 13 year old catcher can get through the challenges of receiving a college pitcher then I know they will have sky high confidence and they will become even more hungry to improve. Find a practice, show case or camp to attend with players that are better then you. Failure will just open your eyes to deficiencies <br> 25 - FOCUS ON CONSISTENT 1% IMPROVEMENTS <br> Making gains in anything can be discouraging and frustrating. Often times you will find yourself over exaggerating what you can do in a day but under estimating what you can accomplish in a day. The best strategy to improve your game is to have a 1% mindset daily and set huge goals in the long term. The 1% focus only works if you are CONSISTENT, so even on off days or rest days there is no excuse for not watching video, visualizing success or reading an inspiring book."

  "body":           "<strong> 3 Effective Ways to Improve Your Baseball Skills </strong> <br> </br> When preparing to get into shape for any sport, such as physical conditioning through drills, repeating the same actions over and over again can become pretty monotonous for any athlete. Baseball practices, for example, are typically jammed with drill after drill in order to improve the skills of the team’s players in various areas. But like all sports, baseball season can only last so long and players may eventually have more free time than usual to improve their skills. However, rather than continue to perform the same drills, consider the fact that there are many other games and sports that exist that you can apply your baseball skills to as well. Best of all, once it’s time to return to the field, you may even find yourself to be a better baseball player than before. <br> Learn & Apply Physics to Improve Your Batting Average <br> Similar to the action of pulling a lever (in terms of an object rotating around a point or axis), when a player swings the bat, the goal is to maximize the force of contact between the bat and the ball by utilizing the power of their body in the most efficient way. While there are several variables that play into this specific motion to make it successful, the force of contact is roughly related to the torque created by swinging the arms and bat, as well as the force of the torso. By determining the distance between the contact point from the axis of rotation, you can then figure out how strong the force of the swing will be. In simpler terms, as a batter you want to get the biggest bang for your buck. You don’t necessarily need to know any special equations to improve your batting average, but knowing how the force of your swings connects with the force of the ball is certainly a must. <br> Practice Yoga to Increase the Power of Your Throws <br> At times, the languid pace of a baseball game can give the impression that its teams’ players are not necessarily fit; however, image can only tell us so much. The fact of the matter is that baseball players need everything from quick and responsive reflexes to exceptional hand-eye coordination. Though likely one of the last activities one would think to complement baseball well, yoga can be very helpful in strengthening and stretching both the mind and body, as well as giving players the advantage of being more focused in their intention for movement. Incorporating yoga into your conditioning routine can be very helpful in building your core strength, which is essential to increasing the power of your pitches and your batting potential. Regardless of whether you are an infielder or outfielder, the flexibility gained in yoga will also increase your stride and follow-through when throwing, which is crucial for pitchers. <br> Play Online Poker to Boost Your Decision Making <br> In addition to keeping your physical strength and abilities in tip-top condition, it’s crucial to keep your mental reflexes just as tough. Especially in a game like baseball, having the ability to make quick decisions is crucial. For example, having to make the decision whether to steal third base or to wait until the pitcher puts the ball in play, or determining where you should aim to hit the ball based on how loaded the bases are. Regardless of whether you’re playing in the outfield or are at bat, being a great baseball player requires that you always be prepared for any situation. While certainly not as physically demanding as playing baseball, online poker is widely known to be one of the best activities to improve mental quickness, patience, observation, self-awareness, and emotional intelligence. In poker, players naturally learn how to continue randomizing their actions when determining when the best time will be to bluff. Most importantly, those who play poker learn about strategic interactions, particularly mixed strategies. A mixed strategy, in game theory, occurs when a player does not make the same move each time. For example, a pitcher will not typically throw the same curveball or fastball each time in order to keep the batter on his toes. Furthermore, playing poker can also increase your math skills, which in turn can improve the way you understand the physics of baseball. <br> <strong> Play Ball! </strong> <br> At first it may seem as like the above activities wouldn’t complement each other at all. And while they may not be necessarily closely connected with baseball, they still offer many benefits to baseball players."

  "body":          "<strong> 10 Ways to become better football Player </strong> <br> <br> 1. Practice Makes Perfect <br> There are countless ways to improve the level of your game, but actually playing your sport is what makes the greatest impact. Malcolm Gladwell, author of the book “Outliers: The Story of Success” (Amazon: USA/UK/FR/ES/DE/IT/BR) spent years researching the common denominators among some of the world’s most successful people. According to Gladwell, the key to success in any field is a matter of practicing a specific task for a total of approximately 10,000 hours. The “10,000-Hour Rule”, as it has come to be known, can be applied directly to sports to make you a top-level athlete. With enough time spent on the football field, you can become a phenom in your league and respected by your peers for your skill and dedication to the game. First and foremost, never miss a team practice. Showing up early to team training to get in some extra work not only gives you an advantage over your teammates and competition, it shows the coaches that you’re committed to the team and to becoming the best player you can be. Outside of scheduled practice time, you can meet up with a fellow teammate to practice skills: catching, blocking, passing, covering, and form tackling are just some of the things you can do. If you can’t find a partner, find time to train on your own. There are elements of every position that you can practice by yourself. Quarterbacks can work on their footwork, drop, and scrambling. Receivers can work on their routes and their release off the line. Linemen can work on their first move, footwork, and hands. Defensive backs can work on their backpedaling and break to the ball…and there’s much more. The question is not what can be done, but rather how committed are you to getting better? <br> 2. Learn the Rules <br> It happens every time a field goal or punt is deflected. Some players simply don’t know what to do – do I pick the ball up and run with it? Do I let it go? What happens if the opposing team picks it up? Even many NFL players are unaware of some of the rules of the game, and it’s their profession. If you don’t believe it, check out Donovan McNabb’s infamous press conference after the Philadelphia Eagles’ 13-13 tie vs. the Cincinnati Bengals in 2008 where he admitted he did had no idea a game could end in a tie. Talk about embarrassing. Knowing the rules better than your opponent can be the difference between winning and losing. Make sure to brush up on the rules of the game so you can avoid the same thing happening to you. Most leagues in Europe play by NCAA rules, so check out the updated NCAA Rule Book to brush up on any gaps in knowledge. Remember, knowing the rules means knowing ALL the rules. <br> 3. Lift, Lift, Lift <br> We all know that putting time in at the gym will get you bigger and faster. Focus on strength and mass, and less about looks. I can’t tell you how many guys I’ve played with that really looked the part, but couldn’t lay a block or make a tackle to save their lives. You’re training for football, not a swimsuit competition. Tim Ferriss, author of “The 4-Hour Body” (Amazon: USA/UK/FR/ES/DE/IT/BR), recommends focusing on a concept called the “minimum effective dose”. Rather than putting in 4-6 sets of one exercise he suggests maxing out on one set of 8+ reps until you can’t move the weight anymore, which is the minimum you need to lift to see the results you want to achieve. This way you’re getting 80 percent of the value with only 20 percent of the time and effort. Make sure you establish a solid plan and record all the details of your workouts. This will enable you to follow your progress and feel a sense of accomplishment every time you reach a personal best. No goal can be reached without a solid and realistic plan to get you there. <br> 4. Diet <br> Many nutritionists have estimated that what you eat accounts for 80% of muscle growth, while training accounts for only 20%. If you don’t watch what you put into your body, you’re unlikely to get the results you want. Protein is vital to muscle growth, and chances are you’re not getting enough protein in your diet. Dr. James Meschino, a renowned expert on dietary health and muscle development, suggests a simple formula to calculate your ideal daily protein intake. Moderately active people that exercise 5-7 times per week, including weight training 3-4 times a week, should multiply their weight in pounds by 0.6 (for kilos, multiply by 1.3) to calculate the number of grams of protein they should eat per day. People who engage in advanced activity, which includes exercise 5-7 times per week and at least 1 hour of weight training 5+ times per week, should multiply their weight in pounds by 0.7 (for kilos, multiply by 1.5) to get their number. Lastly, elite-level athletes should multiply their weight in pounds by 0.8 (for kilos, multiply by 1.7) to maximize their muscle growth. Stay away from processed foods, caffeine, and sugars. Eating meat is fine, but be aware that not all meat provides the same amount of protein per calorie. Lean meats such as chicken and turkey provide more protein with less calorie intake, while fatty meats such as beef and pork have a much higher calorie content. Skill positions such as receivers, defensive backs, running backs, and quarterbacks should focus on building lean mass (high protein/low calorie) while linemen and linebackers should focus on adding bulk (high protein/high calorie). Again, Tim Ferriss’ “The 4-Hour Body” (Amazon: USA/UK/FR/ES/DE/IT) is simply the best work written on the subject. <br> 5. Watch film <br> There’s a reason why Peyton Manning is one of the best in the game. He is not a great athlete, lacks any kind of real speed, has below average arm strength for an NFL quarterback and, is not particularly accurate compared to guys like Tom Brady, Drew Brees, or Aaron Rodgers. However, no one questions Peyton’s preparation and knowledge of the game. Most of this is achieved through the hours and hours he spends studying film. He studies his own game film and practice film, plus game film for upcoming opponents. This makes him mentally superior to almost anyone on the field. Watching film allows you to learn from your mistakes an see things from another perspective. You can also learn new techniques and moves from other players. As Malcolm Gladwell states, “Achievement is talent plus preparation.” Ask your coaches for a copy of their practice or game film to evaluate yourself. If your team hasn’t established a viable filming strategy, help them establish a plan to make this a reality. Be part of the solution. <br> 6. Position Specific Training <br> Make sure you identify the specific skill sets that are valued for your position. If you’re an offensive lineman, strength, size, toughness, and team-first mentality are valued above all else. If you’re a defensive back, quick feet, speed, good instincts, and a short-term memory are most important. Whether you’re in the gym or going for a run, make sure that everything you do centers around those skill sets. Linemen rarely run more than 20-30 yards on a single play, so a 5-mile run is probably not going to provide much value. Quarterbacks rarely need to make a tackle, so taking part in tackling drills is going to be minimally effective. By focusing on your position’s most-valued skill sets, you’ll prevent injuries and focus all of your available time on being the best you can be at your position. You need to be as efficient as possible with your time and effort. <br> 7. Get Your Sleep <br> Your body does 90% of its healing while you are sleeping. This is vitally important during the football season and most-important the night before a game. Alcohol interrupts your sleep cycle as well as the production of testosterone, which is beneficial for building muscle and energy. On game day, you need as much of both as you can get. Testosterone is generated from cholesterol, which is produced between 4:00-6:00am. Keeping a regular sleeping pattern and getting a full night’s sleep will allow your body to recover and give you the energy you need the next time you play. <br> 8. Play against better competition <br> One of the best ways to improve your game is to literally elevate your game. There are all sorts of creative ways to play against better competition. If you’re a Junior, ask the Senior Head Coach about attending Senior practices. Even if you’re only participating at a practice level, performing against players that are bigger, faster, and stronger will only force you to raise your skill level to compete. You may even consider playing for a team in a higher division within your own country, or in another country that has a higher level of play altogether. There are Dutch, Austrian, and Spanish players playing in Germany, for example. If you really want to challenge yourself, consider spending a semester or year abroad in the United States and walking onto the football team at your school. In all of these scenarios, the more you play against the best, the better you will be. <br> 9. Endurance training <br> By the 4th quarter, most football players are performing at about 85-90% of their normal capacity. Imagine if you were able to maintain 100% capacity for the entire length of a game? That would mean that you’d have a significant advantage in crunch time, the point at which most games are decided. If you’re still at peak endurance near the end of the game, you’re playing on an entirely different level than everyone else on the field. That means you have better focus, your coaches are more inclined to call a play that allows you to become the hero, and you garner the confidence of your teammates when the game is on the line. Work to get yourself in game shape by practicing at game speed. The more you play at full speed, the more prepared your body will be for the rigors of a football game. Run 40’s after practice, take more snaps, or run more routes. Just make sure you’re ready to go on game day. <br> 10. Get feedback <br> Ask your coaches for feedback on your play. The benefit of an objective opinion is that they see some things that you may not. You’ll be expressing the fact that you value their opinion and that you are focused on becoming a better player. These are very strong impressions to make in the eyes of a coach. Plus, you’ll be learning a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of your game that’ll give you some confidence and some areas to focus on."

For example, golfers need good hand-eye coordination, timing and depth perception to determine how and where a ball should be hit. <br> Visual memory is a crucial sports vision skill for team players who must make split-second decisions about their next move based on where they see people and objects situated on a field or court. On the other hand, keen visual memory is not as important for bowlers, who operate in a comparatively static environment. Eye-foot coordination is important for soccer and tennis players, while peripheral vision is crucial for basketball. Contrast sensitivity is a key vision skill for skiers, who must see every shadow in the snow before them so they know when to turn. Eye Dominance, Focus Flexibility and Other Sports Vision Skills Here are a few more basic sports vision skills, some that you can practice at home: <br>Focus Flexibility. This is the ability to change focus from a faraway object to a near one, or vice versa. If you are over age 40, you may have noticed that you are losing this ability (accommodation) and need reading glasses, multifocal eyeglasses or bifocal contact lenses to compensate. You can't really improve your focus flexibility as successfully through vision training or eye exercises when loss of this skill is caused by presbyopia. However, everyone can practice focus flexibility by concentrating on switching focus between distant and near objects. Quick Tip: Try frequently changing focus between your computer screen and a picture hanging on the wall across the room, or a scene outside the window. This not only helps your focus flexibility, but it also can relieve eye strain caused by extended time on the computer. <br> Peripheral Awareness. This ability involves perceiving what's going on at either side of you without turning your head. Eye doctors test for peripheral vision loss by having you look straight ahead while lights flash at various angles off to the side. Quick Tip: To improve this aspect of your vision for better sports performance, try looking at a busy scene with your head turned to one side (perhaps on TV or a computer screen, or on a sidewalk). Remember to practice from the left and from the right. <br> Dynamic Visual Acuity. Dynamic visual acuity enables you to see objects clearly when they are moving quickly. You may have 20/20 vision when sitting still and reading an eye chart. But when motion is involved, your visual acuity could be worse. In sports vision testing, you might be asked to view objects or words that move fast across a computer screen and then identify them before they disappear. Quick Tip: For those who still have old-fashioned record players in the home, the American Optometric Association recommends a homemade way to improve dynamic visual acuity: Cut letters of different sizes out of a magazine, put them on the turntable and — at arm's length — identify them as they revolve. Use different speeds (33, 45 and 78 revolutions per minute, or rpm), and then progress to smaller letters if the test becomes too easy. <br> Depth Perception. This visual ability enables you to make spatial judgments, including how far away an object or person is from you. One test for this skill involves identifying objects or shapes that are in random, dot-patterned backgrounds. Some of this ability depends strictly on physical characteristics. For example, spacing between the center of your two pupils (pupillary distance) is thought to play a major role in how well you see in three dimensions. Quick Tip: Ever try to put the cap on a pen and miss? Practicing this skill at arm's length is one way to improve your depth perception. Another method is to hold a very small pebble or BB at arm's length and drop it into a drinking straw. <br> Color Vision. Your ability to detect different colors and shades is important in ball sports such as football. In fact, having a color deficiency can pose extra problems for some athletes. The most common color deficiency is an inability to distinguish red from green, which means a reddish-brown football on a green field could be tough to see. Color deficiency tests include cards with random dot patterns printed in a particular color, along with an object shown in a different color. If you can't view the object, you can't distinguish between the two colors. Some tinted lenses enhance particular colors, such as yellow, by filtering other colors. Even if you're not color deficient, enhancing the color of a ball (such as a yellow tennis ball) could help you see it better, so you have more time to react to it. Performance-enhancing sports eyewear and contact lenses can be designed with different tints for specific sports. Quick Tip: Of course, you can't really practice seeing in different colors if you are color deficient. But you may be able to find special glasses or contacts for color blindness from a limited number of eye doctors in the United States. These specially tinted lenses enhance differences between certain colors to help people with a color vision deficiency better distinguish an object from its background. <br> Hand and Eye Dominance. Understanding which eye dominates may help an athlete adopt better strategies for improving athletic performance. Most athletes know they are either right-handed or left-handed, and they adjust body movements accordingly. But they may not realize that their dominant eye may process visual information more fully and accurately than their non-dominant eye. As an example, knowing which eye dominates can help an athlete achieve better head and eye positioning to interpret fast action in sports such as basketball or baseball. Some athletes are cross-dominant, meaning that a right-handed person is left-eye dominant or a left-handed person is right-eye dominant. This can be an advantage in some sports, but potentially a serious disadvantage in sports such as archery and target shooting where one side of the body is used to both aim and shoot. Quick Tip: In target shooting, a dominant hand and dominant eye tend to work together much more efficiently when they are on the same side of the body. So if you have trouble hitting the target, cross dominance might be the reason. You may need to make adjustments such as switching the hand you usually use to hold your firearm to make sure you are able to view the target with your dominant eye.* Sports Vision Training for Serious Athletes For better sports performance, consider visiting a sports vision specialist for training and testing. Also, an eye doctor who specializes in sports vision can give you valuable advice about special eyewear such as sports safety goggles and performance-enhancing lens tints."
